[KE+62] “One-level Storage System” by T. Kilburn, D.B.G. Edwards, M.J. Lanigan, F.H. Sumner. IRE Trans. EC-11, 2, 1962. Reprinted in Bell and Newell, “Computer Structures: Readings and Examples”. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1971. The Atlas pioneered the idea of dividing memory into ﬁxed-sized pages and in many senses was an early form of the memory-management ideas we see in modern computer systems.

[L78] “The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A Historical Perspective” by S. H. Lavington. Communications of the ACM, Volume 21:1, January 1978.
