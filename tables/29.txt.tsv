[B+10]	An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores	Silas Boyd-Wickizer, Austin T. Clements, Yandong Mao, Aleksey Pesterev, M. Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich . OSDI ’10, Vancouver, Canada, October 2010. 	A great study of how Linux performs on multicore machines, as well as some simple solutions. Includes a neat sloppy counter to solve one form of the scalable counting problem.
[BH73]	Operating System Principles	Per Brinch Hansen. Prentice-Hall, 1973. Available: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=540365. 	One of the ﬁrst books on operating systems; certainly ahead of its time. Introduced monitors as a concurrency primitive.
[BC05]	Understanding the Linux Kernel (Third Edition)	Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati. O’Reilly Media, November 2005. 	The classic book on the Linux kernel. You should read it.
[C06]	The Search For Fast, Scalable Counters	Jonathan Corbet. February 1, 2006. Available: https://lwn.net/Articles/170003. 	LWN has many wonderful articles about the latest in Linux This article is a short description of scalable approximate counting; read it, and others, to learn more about the latest in Linux.
[L+13]	A Study of Linux File System Evolution	Lanyue Lu, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, Shan Lu. FAST ’13, San Jose, CA, February 2013. 	Our paper that studies every patch to Linux ﬁle systems over nearly a decade. Lots of fun ﬁndings in there; read it to see! The work was painful to do though; the poor graduate student, Lanyue Lu, had to look through every single patch by hand in order to understand what they did.
[MS98]	Nonblocking Algorithms and Preemption-safe Locking on by Multiprogrammed Shared-memory Multiprocessors.	M. Michael, M. Scott. Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Vol. 51, No. 1, 1998 	Professor Scott and his students have been at the forefront of concurrent algorithms and data structures for many years; check out his web page, numerous papers, or books to ﬁnd out more.
[MS04]	Concurrent Data Structures	Mark Moir and Nir Shavit. In Handbook of Data Structures and Applications (Editors D. Metha and S.Sahni). Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2004. Available: www.cs.tau.ac.il/˜shanir/concurrent-data-structures.pdf. 	A short but relatively comprehensive reference on concurrent data structures. Though it is missing some of the latest works in the area (due to its age), it remains an incredibly useful reference.
[MM00]	Solaris Internals: Core Kernel Architecture	Jim Mauro and Richard McDougall. Prentice Hall, October 2000. 	The Solaris book. You should also read this, if you want to learn about something other than Linux.
[S+11]	Making the Common Case the Only Case with Anticipatory Memory Allocation	Swaminathan Sundararaman, Yupu Zhang, Sriram Subramanian, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau . FAST ’11, San Jose, CA, February 2011.	Our work on removing possibly-failing allocation calls from kernel code paths. By allocating all potentially needed memory before doing any work, we avoid failure deep down in the storage stack.
