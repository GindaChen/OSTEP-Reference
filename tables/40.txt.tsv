[A+07]	A Five-Year Study of File-System Metadata	Nitin Agrawal, William J. Bolosky, John R. Douceur, Jacob R. Lorch. FAST ’07, San Jose, California, February 2007. 	An excellent recent analysis of how ﬁle systems are actually used. Use the bibliography within to follow the trail of ﬁle-system analysis papers back to the early 1980s.
[B07]	ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems	Jeff Bonwick and Bill Moore. Available from: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/zfs_last.pdf. 	One of the most recent important ﬁle systems, full of features and awesomeness. We should have a chapter on it, and perhaps soon will.
[B02]	The FAT File System	Andries Brouwer. September, 2002. Available online at: http://www.win.tue.nl/˜aeb/linux/fs/fat/fat.html. 	A nice clean description of FAT. The ﬁle system kind, not the bacon kind. Though you have to admit, bacon fat probably tastes better.
[C94]	Inside the Windows NT File System	Helen Custer. Microsoft Press, 1994. 	A short book about NTFS; there are probably ones with more technical details elsewhere.
[H+88]	Scale and Performance in a Distributed File System	John H. Howard, Michael L. Kazar, Sherri G. Menees, David A. Nichols, M. Satyanarayanan, Robert N. Sidebotham, Michael J. West.. ACM TOCS, Volume 6:1, February 1988. 	A classic distributed ﬁle system; we’ll be learning more about it later, don’t worry.
[P09]	The Second Extended File System: Internal Layout	Dave Poirier. 2009. Available: http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html. 	Some details on ext2, a very simple Linux ﬁle system based on FFS, the Berkeley Fast File System. We’ll be reading about it in the next chapter.
[RT74]	The U NIX Time-Sharing System	M. Ritchie, K. Thompson. CACM Volume 17:7, 1974. 	The original paper about UNIX. Read it to see the underpinnings of much of modern operating systems.
[S00]	UBC: An Efﬁcient Uniﬁed I/O and Memory Caching Subsystem for NetBSD	Chuck Silvers. FREENIX, 2000. 	A nice paper about NetBSD’s integration of ﬁle-system buffer caching and the virtual-memory page cache. Many other systems do the same type of thing.
[S+96]	Scalability in the XFS File System	Adan Sweeney, Doug Doucette, Wei Hu, Curtis Anderson, Mike Nishimoto, Geoff Peck. USENIX ’96, January 1996, San Diego, California. 	The ﬁrst attempt to make scalability of operations, including things like having millions of ﬁles in a directory, a central focus. A great example of pushing an idea to the extreme. The key idea behind this ﬁle system: everything is a tree. We should have a chapter on this ﬁle system too.
