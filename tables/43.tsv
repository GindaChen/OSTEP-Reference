[AD14]	"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" (Chapter: Flash-based Solid State Drives) 	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014. 	A bit gauche to refer you to another chapter in this very book, but who are we to judge?
[B07]	ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems	Jeff Bonwick and Bill Moore. Copy Available: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/zfs_last.pdf. 	Slides on ZFS; unfortunately, there is no great ZFS paper (yet). Maybe you will write one, so we can cite it here?
[H+17]	The Unwritten Contract of of Solid State Drives	Jun He, Sudarsun Kannan, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. EuroSys ’17, April 2017. 	Which unwritten rules one must follow to extract high performance from an SSD? Interestingly, both request scale (large or parallel requests) and locality still matter, even on SSDs. The more things change ...
[HLM94]	File System Design for an NFS File Server Appliance	Dave Hitz, James Lau, Michael Malcolm. USENIX Spring ’94. 	WAFL takes many ideas from LFS and RAID and puts it into a high-speed NFS appliance for the multi-billion dollar storage company NetApp.
[L77]	Physical Integrity in a Large Segmented Database	R. Lorie. ACM Transactions on Databases, Volume 2:1, 1977. 	The original idea of shadow paging is presented here.
[MJLF84]	A Fast File System for UNIX	Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Sam J. Lefﬂer, Robert S. Fabry. ACM TOCS, Volume 2:3, August 1984. 	The original FFS paper; see the chapter on FFS for more details.
[MR+97]	Improving the Performance of Log-structured File Systems with Adaptive Methods	Jeanna Neefe Matthews, Drew Roselli, Adam M. Costello, Randolph Y. Wang, Thomas E. Anderson. SOSP 1997, pages 238-251, October, Saint Malo, France. 	A more recent paper detailing better policies for cleaning in LFS.
[M94]	A Better Update Policy	Jeffrey C. Mogul. USENIX ATC ’94, June 1994. 	In this paper, Mogul ﬁnds that read workloads can be harmed by buffering writes for too long and then sending them to the disk in a big burst. Thus, he recommends sending writes more frequently and in smaller batches.
[P98]	Hardware Technology Trends and Database Opportunities	David A. Patterson. ACM SIGMOD ’98 Keynote, 1998. Available online here: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/ ˜pattrsn/talks/keynote.html.	 A great set of slides on technology trends in computer systems. Hopefully, Patterson will create another of these sometime soon.
[R+13]	BTRFS: The Linux B-Tree Filesystem	Ohad Rodeh, Josef Bacik, Chris Mason. ACM Transactions on Storage, Volume 9 Issue 3, August 2013. 	Finally, a good paper on BTRFS, a modern take on copy-on-write ﬁle systems.
[RO91]	Design and Implementation of the Log-structured File System	Mendel Rosenblum and John Ousterhout. SOSP ’91, Paciﬁc Grove, CA, October 1991. 	The original SOSP paper about LFS, which has been cited by hundreds of other papers and inspired many real systems.
[R92]	Design and Implementation of the Log-structured File System	Mendel Rosenblum. http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1992/CSD-92-696.pdf. 	The award-winning dissertation about LFS, with many of the details missing from the paper.
[SS+95]	File system logging versus clustering: a performance comparison	Margo Seltzer, Keith A. Smith, Hari Balakrishnan, Jacqueline Chang, Sara McMains, Venkata Padmanabhan. USENIX 1995 Technical Conference, New Orleans, Louisiana, 1995. 	A paper that showed the LFS performance sometimes has problems, particularly for workloads with many calls to fsync() (such as database workloads). The paper was controversial at the time.
[SO90]	Write-Only Disk Caches	Jon A. Solworth, Cyril U. Orji. SIGMOD ’90, Atlantic City, New Jersey, May 1990. 	An early study of write buffering and its beneﬁts. However, buffering for too long can be harmful: see Mogul [M94] for details.
[Z+12]	De-indirection for Flash-based SSDs with Nameless Writes	Yiying Zhang, Leo Prasath Arulraj, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. FAST ’13, San Jose, California, February 2013. 	Our paper on a new way to build ﬂash-based storage devices, to avoid redundant mappings in the ﬁle system and FTL. The idea is for the device to pick the physical location of a write, and return the address to the ﬁle system, which stores the mapping.
