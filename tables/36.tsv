[A+11]	vIC: Interrupt Coalescing for Virtual Machine Storage Device IO	Irfan Ahmad, Ajay Gulati, Ali Mashtizadeh. USENIX ’11. 	A terriﬁc survey of interrupt coalescing in traditional and virtualized environments.
[AD14]	"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" (Chapters: Crash Consistency: FSCK and Journaling and Log-Structured File Systems) 	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea ArpaciDusseau. Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014. 	A description of a ﬁle-system checker and how it works, which requires low-level access to disk devices not normally provided by the ﬁle system directly.
[C01]	An Empirical Study of Operating System Errors	Andy Chou, Junfeng Yang, Benjamin Chelf, Seth Hallem, Dawson Engler. SOSP ’01. 	One of the ﬁrst papers to systematically explore how many bugs are in modern operating systems. Among other neat ﬁndings, the authors show that device drivers have something like seven times more bugs than mainline kernel code.
[CK+08]	The xv6 Operating System	Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich. From: http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/index.html. 	See ide.c for the IDE device driver, with a few more details therein.
[D07]	What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory	Ulrich Drepper. November, 2007. Available: http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf. 	A fantastic read about modern memory systems, starting at DRAM and going all the way up to virtualization and cache-optimized algorithms.
[G08]	EIO: Error-handling is Occasionally Correct	Haryadi Gunawi, Cindy Rubio-Gonzalez, Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, Ben Liblit. FAST ’08, San Jose, CA, February 2008. 	Our own work on building a tool to ﬁnd code in Linux ﬁle systems that does not handle error return properly. We found hundreds and hundreds of bugs, many of which have now been ﬁxed.
[H17]	Intel Core i7-7700K review: Kaby Lake Debuts for Desktop	Joel Hruska. January 3, 2017. www.extremetech.com/extreme/241950-intels-core-i7-7700k-reviewed-kaby -lake-debuts-desktop. 	An in-depth review of a recent Intel chipset, including CPUs and the I/O subsystem.
[H18]	Hacker News	Many contributors. Available: https://news.ycombinator.com. One of the better aggregrators for tech-related stuff. 	Once back in 2014, this book became a highly-ranked entry, leading to 1 million chapter downloads in just one day! Sadly, we have yet to re-experience such a high.
[L94]	AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives	Lawrence J. Lamers. Reference number: ANSI X3.221, 1994. Available: ftp://ftp.t10.org/t13/project/d0791r4c-ATA-1.pdf. 	A rather dry document about device interfaces. Read it at your own peril.
[MR96]	Eliminating Receive Livelock in an Interrupt-driven Kernel	Jeffrey Mogul, K. K. Ramakrishnan. USENIX ’96, San Diego, CA, January 1996. 	Mogul and colleagues did a great deal of pioneering work on web server network performance. This paper is but one example.
[S08]	Interrupts	Mark Smotherman. July ’08. Available: http://people.cs.clemson.edu/ ˜mark/interrupts.html. 	A treasure trove of information on the history of interrupts, DMA, and related early ideas in computing.
[S03]	Improving the Reliability of Commodity Operating Systems	Michael M. Swift, Brian N. Bershad, Henry M. Levy. SOSP ’03. 	Swift’s work revived interest in a more microkernel-like approach to operating systems; minimally, it ﬁnally gave some good reasons why address-space based protection could be useful in a modern OS.
[W10]	Hard Disk Driver	Washington State Course Homepage. Available online at this site: http://eecs.wsu.edu/˜cs460/cs560/HDdriver.html. 	A nice summary of a simple IDE disk drive’s interface and how to build a device driver for it.
