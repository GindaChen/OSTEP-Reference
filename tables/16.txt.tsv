[CV65]	Introduction and Overview of the Multics System	F. J. Corbato, V. A. Vyssotsky. 	Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1965. One of ﬁve papers presented on Multics at the Fall Joint Computer Conference; oh to be a ﬂy on the wall in that room that day!
[DD68]	Virtual Memory, Processes, and Sharing in Multics	Robert C. Daley and Jack B. Dennis. Communications of the ACM, Volume 11:5, May 1968. 	An early paper on how to perform dynamic linking in Multics, which was way ahead of its time. Dynamic linking ﬁnally found its way back into systems about 20 years later, as the large X-windows libraries demanded it. Some say that these large X11 libraries were MIT’s revenge for removing support for dynamic linking in early versions of U NIX!
[G62]	Fact Segmentation	M. N. Greenﬁeld. Proceedings of the SJCC, Volume 21, May 1962. 	Another early paper on segmentation; so early that it has no references to other work.
[H61]	Program Organization and Record Keeping for Dynamic Storage	A. W. Holt. Communications of the ACM, Volume 4:10, October 1961. 	An incredibly early and difﬁcult to read paper about segmentation and some of its uses.
[I09]	Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manuals	Intel. 2009. Available: http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals. 	Try reading about segmentation in here (Chapter 3 in Volume 3a); it’ll hurt your head, at least a little bit.
[K68]	The Art of Computer Programming: Volume I	Donald Knuth. Addison-Wesley, 1968. 	Knuth is famous not only for his early books on the Art of Computer Programming but for his typesetting system TeX which is still a powerhouse typesetting tool used by professionals today, and indeed to typeset this very book. His tomes on algorithms are a great early reference to many of the algorithms that underly computing systems today.
[L83]	Hints for Computer Systems Design	Butler Lampson. ACM Operating Systems Review, 15:5, October 1983. 	A treasure-trove of sage advice on how to build systems. Hard to read in one sitting; take it in a little at a time, like a ﬁne wine, or a reference manual.
[LL82]	Virtual Memory Management in the VAX/VMS Operating System	Henry M. Levy, Peter H. Lipman. IEEE Computer, Volume 15:3, March 1982. 	A classic memory management system, with lots of common sense in its design. We’ll study it in more detail in a later chapter.
[RK68]	Dynamic Storage Allocation Systems	B. Randell and C.J. Kuehner. Communications of the ACM, Volume 11:5, May 1968. 	A nice overview of the differences between paging and segmentation, with some historical discussion of various machines.
[R69]	A note on storage fragmentation and program segmentation	Brian Randell. Communications of the ACM, Volume 12:7, July 1969. 	One of the earliest papers to discuss fragmentation.
[W+95]	Dynamic Storage Allocation: A Survey and Critical Review	Paul R. Wilson, Mark S. Johnstone, Michael Neely, David Boles. 	International Workshop on Memory Management, Scotland, UK, September 1995. A great survey paper on memory allocators.
