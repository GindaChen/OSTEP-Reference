[D65]	Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control	E. W. Dijkstra. Communications of the ACM, 8(9):569, September 1965. 	Pointed to as the ﬁrst paper of Dijkstra’s where he outlines the mutual exclusion problem and a solution. The solution, however, is not widely used; advanced hardware and OS support is needed, as we will see in the coming chapters.
[D68]	Cooperating sequential processes	Edsger W. Dijkstra. 1968. Available at this site: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD123.PDF. 	Dijkstra has an amazing number of his old papers, notes, and thoughts recorded (for posterity) on this website at the last place he worked, the University of Texas. Much of his foundational work, however, was done years earlier while he was at the Technische Hochshule of Eindhoven (THE), including this famous paper on "cooperating sequential processes”, which basically outlines all of the thinking that has to go into writing multi-threaded programs. Dijkstra discovered much of this while working on an operating system named after his school: the "THE" operating system (said "T", "H", "E", and not like the word "the”).
[GR92]	Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques	Jim Gray and Andreas Reuter. Morgan Kaufmann, September 1992. 	This book is the bible of transaction processing, written by one of the legends of the ﬁeld, Jim Gray. It is, for this reason, also considered Jim Gray’s brain dump”, in which he wrote down everything he knows about how database management systems work. Sadly, Gray passed away tragically a few years back, and many of us lost a friend and great mentor, including the co-authors of said book, who were lucky enough to interact with Gray during their graduate school years.
[L+93]	Atomic Transactions	Nancy Lynch, Michael Merritt, William Weihl, Alan Fekete. Morgan Kaufmann, August 1993.	A nice text on some of the theory and practice of atomic transactions for distributed systems. Perhaps a bit formal for some, but lots of good material is found herein.
[NM92]	What Are Race Conditions? Some Issues and Formalizations	Robert H. B. Netzer and Barton P. Miller. ACM Letters on Programming Languages and Systems, Volume 1:1, March 1992. 	An excellent discussion of the different types of races found in concurrent programs. In this chapter (and the next few), we focus on data races, but later we will broaden to discuss general races as well.
[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the U NIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005. 	As we’ve said many times, buy this book, and read it, in little chunks, preferably before going to bed. This way, you will actually fall asleep more quickly; more importantly, you learn a little more about how to become a serious U NIX programmer.
