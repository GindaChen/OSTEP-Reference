[A70]	The ALOHA System — Another Alternative for Computer Communications	Norman Abramson. The 1970 Fall Joint Computer Conference. 	The ALOHA network pioneered some basic concepts in networking, including exponential back-off and retransmit, which formed the basis for communication in shared-bus Ethernet networks for years.
[BN84]	Implementing Remote Procedure Calls	Andrew D. Birrell, Bruce Jay Nelson. ACM TOCS, Volume 2:1, February 1984. 	The foundational RPC system upon which all others build. Yes, another pioneering effort from our friends at Xerox PARC.
[MK09]	The Effectiveness of Checksums for Embedded Control Networks	Theresa C. Maxino and Philip J. Koopman. IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 6:1, January ’09. 	A nice overview of basic checksum machinery and some performance and robustness comparisons between them.
[LH89]	Memory Coherence in Shared Virtual Memory Systems	Kai Li and Paul Hudak. ACM TOCS, 7:4, November 1989. 	The introduction of software-based shared memory via virtual memory. An intriguing idea for sure, but not a lasting or good one in the end.
[SK09]	Principles of Computer System Design	Jerome H. Saltzer and M. Frans Kaashoek. Morgan-Kaufmann, 2009.	An excellent book on systems, and a must for every bookshelf. One of the few terriﬁc discussions on naming we’ve seen.
[SRC84]	End-To-End Arguments in System Design	Jerome H. Saltzer, David P. Reed, David D. Clark. ACM TOCS, 2:4, November 1984.	A beautiful discussion of layering, abstraction, and where functionality must ultimately reside in computer systems.
[VJ88]	Congestion Avoidance and Control	Van Jacobson. SIGCOMM ’88 . 	A pioneering paper on how clients should adjust to perceived network congestion; deﬁnitely one of the key pieces of technology underlying the Internet, and a must read for anyone serious about systems, and for Van Jacobson’s relatives because well relatives should read all of your papers.
