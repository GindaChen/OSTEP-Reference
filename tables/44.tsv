A lot more detail here about how logging can be used in ﬁle systems; some of the same ideas can be applied inside devices too as need be.
[A15]	Amazon Pricing Study	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau. February, 2015. 	This is not an actual paper, but rather one of the authors going to Amazon and looking at current prices of hard drives and SSDs. You too can repeat this study, and see what the costs are today. Do it!
[B+12]	CORFU: A Shared Log Design for Flash Clusters	M. Balakrishnan, D. Malkhi, V. Prabhakaran, T. Wobber, M. Wei, J. D. Davis. NSDI ’12, San Jose, California, April 2012. 	A new way to think about designing a high-performance replicated log for clusters using Flash.
[BD10]	Write Endurance in Flash Drives: Measurements and Analysis	Simona Boboila, Peter Desnoyers. FAST ’10, San Jose, California, February 2010. 	A cool paper that reverse engineers ﬂash-device lifetimes. Endurance sometimes far exceeds manufacturer predictions, by up to 100×.
[B07]	ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems	Jeff Bonwick and Bill Moore. Available here: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/zfs_last.pdf. 	Was this the last word in ﬁle systems? No, but maybe it’s close.
[CG+09]	Gordon: Using Flash Memory to Build Fast, Power-efﬁcient Clusters for Data-intensive Applications	Adrian M. Caulﬁeld, Laura M. Grupp, Steven Swanson. ASPLOS ’09, Washington, D.C., March 2009. 	Early research on assembling ﬂash into larger-scale clusters; deﬁnitely worth a read.
[CK+09]	Understanding Intrinsic Characteristics and System Implications of Flash Memory based Solid State Drives	Feng Chen, David A. Koufaty, and Xiaodong Zhang. SIGMETRICS/Performance ’09, Seattle, Washington, June 2009. 	An excellent overview of SSD performance problems circa 2009 (though now a little dated).
[G14]	The SSD Endurance Experiment	Geoff Gasior. The Tech Report, September 19, 2014. Available: http://techreport.com/review/27062. 	A nice set of simple experiments measuring performance of SSDs over time. There are many other similar studies; use google to ﬁnd more.
[GC+09]	Characterizing Flash Memory: Anomalies, Observations, and Applications	L. M. Grupp, A. M. Caulﬁeld, J. Coburn, S. Swanson, E. Yaakobi, P. H. Siegel, J. K. Wolf. IEEE MICRO ’09, New York, New York, December 2009. 	Another excellent characterization of ﬂash performance.
[GY+09]	DFTL: a Flash Translation Layer Employing Demand-Based Selective Caching of Page-Level Address Mappings	Aayush Gupta, Youngjae Kim, Bhuvan Urgaonkar. ASPLOS ’09, Washington, D.C., March 2009. 	This paper gives an excellent overview of different strategies for cleaning within hybrid SSDs as well as a new scheme which saves mapping table space and improves performance under many workloads.
[HK+17]	The Unwritten Contract of Solid State Drives	Jun He, Sudarsun Kannan, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. EuroSys ’17, Belgrade, Serbia, April 2017. 	Our own paper which lays out ﬁve rules clients should follow in order to get the best performance out of modern SSDs. The rules are request scale, locality, aligned sequentiality, grouping by death time, and uniform lifetime. Read the paper for details!
[H+14]	An Aggressive Worn-out Flash Block Management Scheme To Alleviate SSD Performance Degradation	Ping Huang, Guanying Wu, Xubin He, Weijun Xiao. EuroSys ’14, 2014. 	Recent work showing how to really get the most out of worn-out ﬂash blocks; neat!
[J10]	Failure Mechanisms and Models for Semiconductor Devices	Unknown author. Report JEP122F, November 2010. Available on the internet at this exciting so-called web site: http://www.jedec.org/sites/default/files/docs/JEP122F.pdf. 	A highly detailed discussion of what is going on at the device level and how such devices fail. Only for those not faint of heart. Or physicists. Or both.
[KK+02]	A Space-Efﬁcient Flash Translation Layer For Compact Flash Systems	Jesung Kim, Jong Min Kim, Sam H. Noh, Sang Lyul Min, Yookun Cho. IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, Volume 48, Number 2, May 2002. 	One of the earliest proposals to suggest hybrid mappings.
[L+07]	A Log Buffer-Based Flash Translation Layer by Using Fully-Associative Sector Translation.	Sang-won Lee, Tae-Sun Chung, Dong-Ho Lee, Sangwon Park, Ha-Joo Song. ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Volume 6, Number 3, July 2007 	A terriﬁc paper about how to build hybrid log/block mappings.
[M+14]	A Survey of Address Translation Technologies for Flash Memories	Dongzhe Ma, Jianhua Feng, Guoliang Li. ACM Computing Surveys, Volume 46, Number 3, January 2014. 	Probably the best recent survey of ﬂash and related technologies.
[S13]	The Seagate 600 and 600 Pro SSD Review	Anand Lal Shimpi. AnandTech, May 7, 2013. Available: http://www.anandtech.com/show/6935/seagate-600-ssd-review. 	One of many SSD performance measurements available on the internet. Haven’t heard of the internet? No problem. Just go to your web browser and type "internet" into the search tool. You’ll be amazed at what you can learn.
[T15]	Performance Charts Hard Drives	Tom’s Hardware. January 2015. Available here: http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/enterprise-hdd-charts. 	Yet another site with performance data, this time focusing on hard drives.
[V12]	Understanding TLC Flash	Kristian Vatto. AnandTech, September, 2012. Available: http://www.anandtech.com/show/5067/understanding-tlc-nand. 	A short description about TLC ﬂash and its characteristics.
[W15]	List of Ships Sunk by Icebergs	Many authors. Available at this location on the "web": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of ships sunk by icebergs. 	Yes, there is a wikipedia page about ships sunk by icebergs. It is a really boring page and basically everyone knows the only ship the iceberg-sinking-maﬁa cares about is the Titanic.
[Z+12]	De-indirection for Flash-based SSDs with Nameless Writes	Yiying Zhang, Leo Prasath Arulraj, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. FAST ’13, San Jose, California, February 2013. 	Our research on a new idea to reduce mapping table space; the key is to re-use the pointers in the ﬁle system above to store locations of blocks, instead of adding another level of indirection.
