[BH70] 	The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System 	Per Brinch Hansen. Communications of the ACM, 13:4, April 1970. 	The ﬁrst paper to suggest that the OS, or kernel, should be a minimal and ﬂexible substrate for building customized operating systems; this theme is revisited throughout OS research history.
[CV65] 	Introduction and Overview of the Multics System 	F. J. Corbato, V. A. Vyssotsky. Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1965. 	A great early Multics paper. Here is the great quote about time sharing: The impetus for time-sharing ﬁrst arose from professional programmers because of their constant frustration in debugging programs at batch processing installations. Thus, the original goal was to time-share computers to allow simultaneous access by several persons while giving to each of them the illusion of having the whole machine at his disposal.”
[DV66] 	Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations 	Jack B. Dennis, Earl C. Van Horn. Communications of the ACM, Volume 9, Number 3, March 1966. 	An early paper (but not the ﬁrst) on multiprogramming.
[L60] 	Man-Computer Symbiosis 	J. C. R. Licklider. IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics, HFE-1:1, March 1960. 	A funky paper about how computers and people are going to enter into a symbiotic age; clearly well ahead of its time but a fascinating read nonetheless.
[M62] 	Time-Sharing Computer Systems 	J. McCarthy. Management and the Computer of the Future, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1962. 	Probably McCarthy’s earliest recorded paper on time sharing. In another paper [M83], he claims to have been thinking of the idea since 1957. McCarthy left the systems area and went on to become a giant in Artiﬁcial Intelligence at Stanford, including the creation of the LISP programming language. See McCarthy’s home page for more info: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/
[M+63] 	A Time-Sharing Debugging System for a Small Computer 	J. McCarthy, S. Boilen, E. Fredkin, J. C. R. Licklider. AFIPS ’63 (Spring), New York, NY, May 1963. 	A great early example of a system that swapped program memory to the drum” when the program wasn’t running, and then back into core” memory when it was about to be run.
[M83] 	Reminiscences on the History of Time Sharing 	John McCarthy. 1983. Available: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html. 	A terriﬁc historical note on where the idea of time-sharing might have come fzshortm, including some doubts towards those who cite Strachey’s work [S59] as the by pioneering work in this area..
[NS07] 	Valgrind: A Framework for Heavyweight Dynamic Binary Instrumentation 	N. Nethercote, J. Seward. PLDI 2007, San Diego, California, June 2007. 	Valgrind is a lifesaver of a program for those who use unsafe languages like C. Read this paper to learn about its very cool binary instrumentation techniques – it’s really quite impressive.
[R+89] 	Mach: A System Software kernel 	R. Rashid, D. Julin, D. Orr, R. Sanzi, R. Baron, A. Forin, D. Golub, M. Jones. COMPCON ’89, February 1989. 	Although not the ﬁrst project on microkernels per se, the Mach project at CMU was well-known and inﬂuential; it still lives today deep in the bowels of Mac OS X.
[S59] 	Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers 	C. Strachey. Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Processing, UNESCO, June 1959. 	One of the earliest references on time sharing.
[S+03] 	Improving the Reliability of Commodity Operating Systems 	M. M. Swift, B. N. Bershad, H. M. Levy. SOSP ’03. 	The ﬁrst paper to show how microkernel-like thinking can improve operating system reliability.
