[B+13]	Efﬁcient Virtual Memory for Big Memory Servers	A. Basu, J. Gandhi, J. Chang, M. D. Hill, M. M. Swift. ISCA ’13, June 2013, Tel-Aviv, Israel. 	A recent work showing that TLBs matter, consuming 10% of cycles for large-memory workloads. The solution: one massive segment to hold large data sets. We go backward, so that we can go forward!
[BB+72]	TENEX, A Paged Time Sharing System for the PDP-10	D. G. Bobrow, J. D. Burchﬁel, D. L. Murphy, R. S. Tomlinson. CACM, Volume 15, March 1972. 	An early time-sharing OS where a number of good ideas came from. Copy-on-write was just one of those; also an inspiration for other aspects of modern systems, including process management, virtual memory, and ﬁle systems.
[BJ81]	Converting a Swap-Based System to do Paging in an Architecture Lacking Page-Reference Bits	O. Babaoglu, W. N. Joy. SOSP ’81, Paciﬁc Grove, California, December 1981. 	How to exploit existing protection machinery to emulate reference bits, from a group at Berkeley working on their own version of UNIX: the Berkeley Systems Distribution (BSD). The group was inﬂuential in the development of virtual memory, ﬁle systems, and networking.
[BC05]	Understanding the Linux Kernel	D. P. Bovet, M. Cesati. O’Reilly Media, November 2005. 	One of the many books you can ﬁnd on Linux, which are out of date, but still worthwhile.
[C03]	The Innovator’s Dilemma	Clayton M. Christenson. Harper Paperbacks, January 2003. 	A fantastic book about the disk-drive industry and how new innovations disrupt existing ones. A good read for business majors and computer scientists alike. Provides insight on how large and successful companies completely fail.
[C93]	Inside Windows NT	H. Custer, D. Solomon. Microsoft Press, 1993. 	The book about Windows NT that explains the system top to bottom, in more detail than you might like. But seriously, a pretty good book.
[G04]	Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager	M. Gorman. Prentice Hall, 2004. 	An in-depth look at Linux VM, but alas a little out of date.
[G+17]	KASLR is Dead: Long Live KASLR	D. Gruss, M. Lipp, M. Schwarz, R. Fellner, C. Maurice, S. Mangard. Engineering Secure Software and Systems, 2017. Available: https://gruss.cc/files/kaiser.pdf 	Excellent info on KASLR, KPTI, and beyond.
[JS94]	2Q: A Low Overhead High Performance Buffer Management Replacement Algorithm	T. Johnson, D. Shasha. VLDB ’94, Santiago, Chile. 	A simple but effective approach to building page replacement.
[LL82]	Virtual Memory Management in the VAX/VMS Operating System	H. Levy, P. Lipman. IEEE Computer, Volume 15:3, March 1982. 	Read the original source of most of this material. Particularly important if you wish to go to graduate school, where all you do is read papers, work, read some more papers, work more, eventually write a paper, and then work some more.
[M04]	Cloud Atlas	D. Mitchell. Random House, 2004. 	It’s hard to pick a favorite book. There are too many! Each is great in its own unique way. But it’d be hard for these authors not to pick Cloud Atlas”, a fantastic, sprawling epic about the human condition, from where the the last quote of this chapter is lifted. If you are smart – and we think you are – you should stop reading obscure commentary in the references and instead read Cloud Atlas”; you’ll thank us later.
[O16]	Virtual Memory and Linux	A. Ott. Embedded Linux Conference, April 2016. https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/ﬁles/slides/elc 2016 mem.pdf . 	A useful set of slides which gives an overview of the Linux VM.
[RL81]	Segmented FIFO Page Replacement	R. Turner, H. Levy. SIGMETRICS ’81, Las Vegas, Nevada, September 1981. 	A short paper that shows for some workloads, segmented FIFO can approach the performance of LRU.
[S07]	The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)	H. Shacham. CCS ’07, October 2007. 	A generalization of return-to-libc. Dr. Beth Garner said in Basic Instinct, She’s crazy! She’s brilliant!” We might say the same about ROP.
[S+04]	On the Effectiveness of Address-space Randomization	H. Shacham, M. Page, B. Pfaff, E. J. Goh, N. Modadugu, D. Boneh. CCS ’04, October 2004. 	A description of the return-tolibc attack and its limits. Start reading, but be wary: the rabbit hole of systems security is deep...
