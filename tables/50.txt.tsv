[B+91]	Measurements of a Distributed File System	Mary Baker, John Hartman, Martin Kupfer, Ken Shirriff, John Ousterhout. SOSP ’91, Paciﬁc Grove, California, October 1991. 	An early paper measuring how people use distributed ﬁle systems. Matches much of the intuition found in AFS.
[H+11]	A File is Not a File: Understanding the I/O Behavior of Apple Desktop Applications	Tyler Harter, Chris Dragga, Michael Vaughn, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. ArpaciDusseau. SOSP ’11, New York, New York, October 2011. 	Our own paper studying the behavior of Apple Desktop workloads; turns out they are a bit different than many of the server-based workloads the systems research community usually focuses upon. Also a good recent reference which points to a lot of related work.
[H+88]	Scale and Performance in a Distributed File System	John H. Howard, Michael L. Kazar, Sherri G. Menees, David A. Nichols, M. Satyanarayanan, Robert N. Sidebotham, Michael J. West. ACM Transactions on Computing Systems (ACM TOCS), Volume 6:1, February 1988. 	The long journal version of the famous AFS system, still in use in a number of places throughout the world, and also probably the earliest clear thinking on how to build distributed ﬁle systems. A wonderful combination of the science of measurement and principled engineering.
[R+00]	A Comparison of File System Workloads	Drew Roselli, Jacob R. Lorch, Thomas E. Anderson. USENIX ’00, San Diego, California, June 2000. 	A more recent set of traces as compared to the Baker paper [B+91], with some interesting twists.
[S+85]	The ITC Distributed File System: Principles and Design	M. Satyanarayanan, J.H. Howard, D.A. Nichols, R.N. Sidebotham, A. Spector, M.J. West. SOSP ’85, Orcas Island, Washington, December 1985. 	The older paper about a distributed ﬁle system. Much of the basic design of AFS is in place in this older system, but not the improvements for scale. The name change to "Andrew” is an homage to two people both named Andrew, Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon. These two rich dudes started the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, respectively, which eventually merged to become what is now known as Carnegie Mellon University.
[V99]	File system usage in Windows NT 4.0	Werner Vogels. SOSP ’99, Kiawah Island Resort, South Carolina, December 1999. 	A cool study of Windows workloads, which are inherently different than many of the U NIX-based studies that had previously been done.
