[A90] 	The Performance of Spin Lock Alternatives for Shared-Memory Multiprocessors 	Thomas E. Anderson. IEEE TPDS Volume 1:1, January 1990. 	A classic paper on how different locking alternatives do and don’t scale. By Tom Anderson, very well known researcher in both systems and networking. And author of a very ﬁne OS textbook, we must say.
[B+10] 	An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores Abstract 	Silas Boyd-Wickizer, Austin T. Clements, Yandong Mao, Aleksey Pesterev, M. Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich. OSDI ’10, Vancouver, Canada, October 2010. 	A terriﬁc modern paper on the difﬁculties of scaling Linux to many cores.
[CSG99] 	Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach 	David E. Culler, Jaswinder Pal Singh, and Anoop Gupta. Morgan Kaufmann, 1999. 	A treasure ﬁlled with details about parallel machines and algorithms. As Mark Hill humorously observes on the jacket, the book contains more information than most research papers.
[FLR98] 	The Implementation of the Cilk-5 Multithreaded Language 	Matteo Frigo, Charles E. Leiserson, Keith Randall. PLDI ’98, Montreal, Canada, June 1998. 	Cilk is a lightweight language and runtime for writing parallel programs, and an excellent example of the work-stealing paradigm.
[G83] 	Using Cache Memory To Reduce Processor-Memory Trafﬁc 	James R. Goodman. ISCA ’83, Stockholm, Sweden, June 1983. 	The pioneering paper on how to use bus snooping, i.e., paying attention to requests you see on the bus, to build a cache coherence protocol. Goodman’s research over many years at Wisconsin is full of cleverness, this being but one example.
[M11] 	Towards Transparent CPU Scheduling 	Joseph T. Meehean. Doctoral Dissertation at University of Wisconsin—Madison, 2011. 	A dissertation that covers a lot of the details of how modern Linux multiprocessor scheduling works. Pretty awesome! But, as co-advisors of Joe’s, we may be a bit biased here.
[SHW11] 	A Primer on Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence 	Daniel J. Sorin, Mark D. Hill, and David A. Wood. Synthesis Lectures in Computer Architecture. Morgan and Claypool Publishers, May 2011. 	A deﬁnitive overview of memory consistency and multiprocessor caching. Required reading for anyone who likes to know way too much about a given topic.
[SA96] 	Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First: A Flexible and Accurate Mechanism for Proportional Share Resource Allocation 	Ion Stoica and Hussein Abdel-Wahab. Technical Report TR-95-22, Old Dominion University, 1996. 	A tech report on this cool scheduling idea, from Ion Stoica, now a professor at U.C. Berkeley and world expert in networking, distributed systems, and many other things.
[TTG95] 	Evaluating the Performance of Cache-Afﬁnity Scheduling in Shared-Memory Multiprocessors 	Josep Torrellas, Andrew Tucker, Anoop Gupta. Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Volume 24:2, February 1995. 	This is not the ﬁrst paper on the topic, but it has citations to earlier work, and is a more readable and practical paper than some of the earlier queuingbased analysis papers.
