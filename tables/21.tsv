[CS94]	Take Our Word For it 	F. Corbato, R. Steinberg. www.takeourword.com/TOW146 (Page 4). 	Richard Steinberg writes: Someone has asked me the origin of the word daemon as it applies to computing. Best I can tell based on my research, the word was ﬁrst used by people on your team at Project MAC using the IBM 7094 in 1963.” Professor Corbato replies: Our use of the word daemon was inspired by the Maxwell’s daemon of physics and thermodynamics (my background is in physics). Maxwell’s daemon was an imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background. We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform system chores.”
