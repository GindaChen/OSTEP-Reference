[HJ92]	Purify: Fast Detection of Memory Leaks and Access Errors	R. Hastings, B. Joyce. USENIX Winter ’92. 	The paper behind the cool Purify tool, now a commercial product.
[KR88]	The C Programming Language	Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie. Prentice-Hall 1988. 	The C book, by the developers of C. Read it once, do some programming, then read it again, and then keep it near your desk or wherever you program.
[N+07]	Exterminator: Automatically Correcting Memory Errors with High Probability	G. Novark, E. D. Berger, B. G. Zorn. PLDI 2007, San Diego, California. 	A cool paper on ﬁnding and correcting memory errors automatically, and a great overview of many common errors in C and C++ programs. An extended version of this paper is available CACM (Volume 51, Issue 12, December 2008).
[SN05]	Using Valgrind to Detect Undeﬁned Value Errors with Bit-precision	J. Seward, N. Nethercote. USENIX ’05. 	How to use valgrind to ﬁnd certain types of errors.
[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the U NIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005. 	We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: read this book many times and use it as a reference whenever you are in doubt. The authors are always surprised at how each time they read something in this book, they learn something new, even after many years of C programming.
[W06]	Survey on Buffer Overﬂow Attacks and Countermeasures	T. Werthman. Available: www.nds.rub.de/lehre/seminar/SS06/Werthmann BufferOverﬂow.pdf. 	A nice survey of buffer overﬂows and some of the security problems they cause. Refers to many of the famous exploits.
