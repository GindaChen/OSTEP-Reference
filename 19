[BC91] “Performance from Architecture: Comparing a RISC and a CISC with Similar Hardware Organization” by D. Bhandarkar and Douglas W. Clark. Communications of the ACM, September 1991. A great and fair comparison between RISC and CISC. The bottom line: on similar hardware, RISC was about a factor of three better in performance.

[CM00] “The evolution of RISC technology at IBM” by John Cocke, V. Markstein. IBM Journal of Research and Development, 44:1/2. A summary of the ideas and work behind the IBM 801, which many consider the ﬁrst true RISC microprocessor.

[C95] “The Core of the Black Canyon Computer Corporation” by John Couleur. IEEE Annals of History of Computing, 17:4, 1995. In this fascinating historical note, Couleur talks about how he invented the TLB in 1964 while working for GE, and the fortuitous collaboration that thus ensued with the Project MAC folks at MIT.

[CG68] “Shared-access Data Processing System” by John F. Couleur, Edward L. Glaser. Patent 3412382, November 1968. The patent that contains the idea for an associative memory to store address translations. The idea, according to Couleur, came in 1964.

[CP78] “The architecture of the IBM System/370” by R.P. Case, A. Padegs. Communications of the ACM. 21:1, 73-96, January 1978. Perhaps the ﬁrst paper to use the term translation lookaside buffer. The name arises from the historical name for a cache, which was a lookaside buffer as called by those developing the Atlas system at the University of Manchester; a cache of address translations thus became a translation lookaside buffer. Even though the term lookaside buffer fell out of favor, TLB seems to have stuck, for whatever reason.

[H93] “MIPS R4000 Microprocessor User’s Manual”. by Joe Heinrich. Prentice-Hall, June 1993. Available: http://cag.csail.mit.edu/raw/ . documents/R4400 Uman book Ed2.pdf A manual, one that is surprisingly readable. Or is it?

[HP06] “Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach” by John Hennessy and David Patterson. Morgan-Kaufmann, 2006. A great book about computer architecture. We have a particular attachment to the classic ﬁrst edition.

[I09] “Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manuals” by Intel, 2009. Available: http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals. In particular, pay attention to “Volume 3A: System Programming Guide” Part 1 and “Volume 3B: System Programming Guide Part 2”.

[PS81] “RISC-I: A Reduced Instruction Set VLSI Computer” by D.A. Patterson and C.H. Sequin. ISCA ’81, Minneapolis, May 1981. The paper that introduced the term RISC, and started the avalanche of research into simplifying computer chips for performance.

[SB92] “CPU Performance Evaluation and Execution Time Prediction Using Narrow Spectrum Benchmarking” by Rafael H. Saavedra-Barrera. EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley. Technical Report No. UCB/CSD-92-684, February 1992.. A great dissertation about how to predict execution time of applications by breaking them down into constituent pieces and knowing the cost of each piece. Probably the most interesting part that comes out of this work is the tool to measure details of the cache hierarchy (described in Chapter 5). Make sure to check out the wonderful diagrams therein.

[W03] “A Survey on the Interaction Between Caching, Translation and Protection” by Adam Wiggins. University of New South Wales TR UNSW-CSE-TR-0321, August, 2003. An excellent survey of how TLBs interact with other parts of the CPU pipeline, namely hardware caches.

[WG00] “The SPARC Architecture Manual: Version 9” by David L. Weaver and Tom Germond. SPARC International, San Jose, California, September 2000. Available: www.sparc.org/ standards/SPARCV9.pdf. Another manual. I bet you were hoping for a more fun citation to end this chapter.
