Chapter	ID	Title	AuthorList	Description
0	[HP90]	Computer Architecture a Quantitative Approach” (1st ed.)	David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy . Morgan-Kaufman, 1990.	A book that encouraged each of us at our undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate studies; we later both had the pleasure of working with Patterson, who greatly shaped the foundations of our research careers.
0	[F96]	Six Easy Pieces: Essentials Of Physics Explained By Its Most Brilliant Teacher	Richard P. Feynman. Basic Books, 1996.	This book reprints the six easiest chapters of Feynman’s Lectures on Physics, from 1963. If you like Physics, it is a fantastic read.
0	[KR88]	The C Programming Language” 	Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. PrenticeHall, April 1988	The C programming reference that everyone should have, by the people who invented the language.
0	[K62]	The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions 	Thomas S. Kuhn. University of Chicago Press, 1962.	A great and famous read about the fundamentals of the scientiﬁc process. Mop-up work, anomaly, crisis, and revolution. We are mostly destined to do mop-up work, alas.
0	[CK+08]	The xv6 Operating system	Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich 	From: http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/index.html. xv6 was developed as a port of the original U NIX version 6 and represents a beautiful, clean, and simple way to understand a modern operating system.
2	[BOH10]	Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective 	R. Bryant and D. O’Hallaron. Addison-Wesley, 2010.	Another great intro to how computer systems work. Has a little bit of overlap with this book — so if you’d like, you can skip the last few chapters of that book, or simply read them to get a different perspective on some of the same material. After all, one good way to build up your own knowledge is to hear as many other perspectives as possible, and then develop your own opinion and thoughts on the matter. You know, by thinking!
2	[PP03]	Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond 	Yale N. Patt, Sanjay J. Patel. McGraw-Hill, 2003.	One of our favorite intro to computing systems books. Starts at transistors and gets you all the way up to C; the early material is particularly great.
2	[SS+10]	Membrane: Operating System Support for Restartable File Systems 	S. Sundararaman, S. Subramanian, A. Rajimwale, A. Arpaci-Dusseau, R. Arpaci-Dusseau, M. Swift. FAST ’10, San Jose, CA, February 2010.	The great thing about writing your own class notes: you can advertise your own research. But this paper is actually pretty neat — when a ﬁle system hits a bug and crashes, Membrane auto-magically restarts it, all without applications or the rest of the system being affected.
2	[K+61]	One-Level Storage System 	 T. Kilburn, D.B.G. Edwards, M.J. Lanigan, F.H. Sumner. 	IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers, April 1962. The Atlas pioneered much of what you see in modern systems. However, this paper is not the best read. If you were to only read one, you might try the historical perspective below [L78].
2	[S68]	SDS 940 Time-Sharing System	Scientiﬁc Data Systems. TECHNICAL MANUAL, SDS 90 11168, August 1968.	Yes, a technical manual was the best we could ﬁnd. But it is fascinating to read these old system documents, and see how much was already in place in the late 1960’s. One of the minds behind the Berkeley Time-Sharing System (which eventually became the SDS system) was Butler Lampson, who later won a Turing award for his contributions in systems.
2	[B+72]	TENEX, A Paged Time Sharing System for the PDP-10	D. Bobrow, J. Burchﬁel, D. Murphy, R. Tomlinson. CACM, Volume 15, Number 3, March 1972.	TENEX has much of the machinery found in modern operating systems; read more about it to see how much innovation was already in place in the early 1970’s.
2	[BH00]	The Evolution of Operating Systems 	P. Brinch Hansen. In ’Classic Operating Systems: From Batch Processing to Distributed Systems.’ Springer-Verlag, New York, 2000.	This essay provides an intro to a wonderful collection of papers about historically signiﬁcant systems.
2	[G85]	The GNU Manifesto 	R. Stallman. 1985. www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html.	A huge part of Linux’s success was no doubt the presence of an excellent compiler, gcc, and other relevant pieces of open software, thanks to the GNU effort headed by Stallman. Stallman is a visionary when it comes to open source, and this manifesto lays out his thoughts as to why.
2	[L78]	The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A Historical Perspective 	S. H. Lavington. Communications of the ACM, Volume 21:1, January 1978.	A nice piece of history on the early development of computer systems and the pioneering efforts of the Atlas. Of course, one could go back and read the Atlas papers themselves, but this paper provides a great overview and adds some historical perspective.
2	[O72]	The Multics System: An Examination of its Structure 	Elliott Organick. MIT Press, 1972.	A great overview of Multics. So many good ideas, and yet it was an over-designed system, shooting for too much, and thus never really worked. A classic example of what Fred Brooks would call the second-system effect [B75].
2	[B75]	The Mythical Man-Month 	F. Brooks. Addison-Wesley, 1975.	A classic text on software engineering; well worth the read.
2	[RT74]	The U NIX Time-Sharing System 	Dennis M. Ritchie, Ken Thompson. CACM, Volume 17: 7, July 1974.	A great summary of U NIX written as it was taking over the world of computing, by the people who wrote it.
2	[BS+09]	Tolerating File-System Mistakes with EnvyFS 	L. Bairavasundaram, S. Sundararaman, A. Arpaci-Dusseau, R. Arpaci-Dusseau. USENIX ’09, San Diego, CA, June 2009.	A fun paper about using multiple ﬁle systems at once to tolerate a mistake in any one of them.
4	[L+75]	Policy/mechanism separation in Hydra 	R. Levin, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, F. Pollack, W. Wulf. SOSP ’75, Austin, Texas, November 1975.	An early paper about how to structure operating systems in a research OS known as Hydra. While Hydra never became a mainstream OS, some of its ideas inﬂuenced OS designers.
4	[DV66]	Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations 	 Jack B. Dennis, Earl C. Van Horn. 	Communications of the ACM, Volume 9, Number 3, March 1966 . This paper deﬁned many of the early terms and concepts around building multiprogrammed systems.
4	[V+65]	Structure of the Multics Supervisor 	V.A. Vyssotsky, F. J. Corbato, R. M. Graham. Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1965.	An early paper on Multics, which described many of the basic ideas and terms that we ﬁnd in modern systems. Some of the vision behind computing as a utility are ﬁnally being realized in modern cloud systems.
4	[BH70]	The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System 	Per Brinch Hansen. Communications of the ACM, Volume 13:4, April 1970.	This paper introduces one of the ﬁrst microkernels in operating systems history, called Nucleus. The idea of smaller, more minimal systems is a theme that rears its head repeatedly in OS history; it all began with Brinch Hansen’s work described herein.
4	[CK+08]	The xv6 Operating System	Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich. From: https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.	The coolest real and little OS in the world. Download and play with it to learn more about the details of how operating systems actually work. We have been using an older version (2012-01-30-1-g1c41342) and hence some examples in the book may not match the latest in the source.
5	[B+19]	A fork() in the road 	Andrew Baumann, Jonathan Appavoo, Orran Krieger, Timothy Roscoe. HotOS ’19, Bertinoro, Italy.	A fun paper full of fork()ing rage. Read it to get an opposing viewpoint on the U NIX process API. Presented at the always lively HotOS workshop, where systems researchers go to present extreme opinions in the hopes of pushing the community in new directions.
5	[C63]	A Multiprocessor System Design 	Melvin E. Conway. AFIPS ’63 Fall Joint Computer Conference, New York, USA 1963.	An early paper on how to design multiprocessing systems; may be the ﬁrst place the term fork() was used in the discussion of spawning new processes.
5	[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005.	All nuances and subtleties of using U NIX APIs are found herein. Buy this book! Read it! And most importantly, live it.
5	[L83]	Hints for Computer Systems Design 	Butler Lampson. ACM Operating Systems Review, Volume 15:5, October 1983.	Lampson’s famous hints on how to design computer systems. You should read it at some point in your life, and probably at many points in your life.
5	[DV66]	Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations 	Jack B. Dennis and Earl C. Van Horn. Communications of the ACM, Volume 9, Number 3, March 1966.	A classic paper that outlines the basics of multiprogrammed computer systems. Undoubtedly had great inﬂuence on Project MAC, Multics, and eventually U NIX.
5	[J16]	They could be twins! 	Phoebe Jackson-Edwards. The Daily Mail. March 1, 2016..	This hard-hitting piece of journalism shows a bunch of weirdly similar child/parent photos and is frankly kind of mesmerizing. Go ahead, waste two minutes of your life and check it out. But don’t forget to come back here! This, in a microcosm, is the danger of surﬁng the web.
5	[QI15]	With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility 	The Quote Investigator. Available: https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/07/23/great-power.	The quote investigator concludes that the earliest mention of this concept is 1793, in a collection of decrees made at the French National Convention. The speciﬁc quote: Ils doivent envisager qu’une grande responsabilit est la suite insparable d’un grand pouvoir”, which roughly translates to They must consider that great responsibility follows inseparably from great power.” Only in 1962 did the following words appear in Spider-Man: ...with great power there must also come–great responsibility!” So it looks like the French Revolution gets credit for this one, not Stan Lee. Sorry, Stan.
6	[M+63]	A Time-Sharing Debugging System for a Small Computer 	J. McCarthy, S. Boilen, E. Fredkin, J. C. R. Licklider. AFIPS ’63 (Spring), May, 1963, New York, USA. An early paper about time-sharing that refers to using a timer interrupt; the quote that discusses it:	The basic task of the channel 17 clock routine is to decide whether to remove the current user from core and if so to decide which user program to swap in as he goes out.”
6	[A79]	Alto User’s Handbook 	Xerox. Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, September 1979. Available: http://history-computer.com/Library/AltoUsersHandbook.pdf.	An amazing system, way ahead of its time. Became famous because Steve Jobs visited, took notes, and built Lisa and eventually Mac.
6	[I11]	Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual	Volume 3A and 3B: System Programming Guide. Intel Corporation, January 2011.	This is just a boring manual, but sometimes those are useful.
6	[MS96]	lmbench: Portable tools for performance analysis 	Larry McVoy and Carl Staelin. USENIX Annual Technical Conference, January 1996.	A fun paper about how to measure a number of different things about your OS and its performance. Download lmbench and give it a try.
6	[M11]	Mac OS 9	Apple Computer, Inc.. January 2011. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Mac OS 9 .	You can probably even ﬁnd an OS 9 emulator out there if you want to; check it out, it’s a fun little Mac!
6	[C+04]	Microreboot — A Technique for Cheap Recovery 	G. Candea, S. Kawamoto, Y. Fujiki, G. Friedman, A. Fox. OSDI ’04, San Francisco, CA, December 2004.	An excellent paper pointing out how far one can go with reboot in building more robust systems.
6	[K+61]	One-Level Storage System 	T. Kilburn, D.B.G. Edwards, M.J. Lanigan, F.H. Sumner. IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers, April 1962.	The Atlas pioneered much of what you see in modern systems. However, this paper is not the best one to read. If you were to only read one, you might try the historical perspective below [L78].
6	[S07]	The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)	Hovav Shacham. CCS ’07, October 2007.	One of those awesome, mind-blowing ideas that you’ll see in research from time to time. The author shows that if you can jump into code arbitrarily, you can essentially stitch together any code sequence you like (given a large code base); read the paper for the details. The technique makes it even harder to defend against malicious attacks, alas.
6	[L78]	The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A Historical Perspective 	S. H. Lavington. Communications of the ACM, 21:1, January 1978.	A history of the early development of computers and the pioneering efforts of Atlas.
6	[P10]	The Single UNIX Speciﬁcation, Version 3	The Open Group, May 2010. Available: http://www.unix.org/version3/.	This is hard and painful to read, so probably avoid it if you can. Like, unless someone is paying you to read it. Or, you’re just so curious you can’t help it!
6	[O90]	Why Aren’t Operating Systems Getting Faster as Fast as Hardware? 	J. Ousterhout. USENIX Summer Conference, June 1990.	A classic paper on the nature of operating system performance.
7	[K64]	Analysis of a Time-Shared Processor 	Leonard Kleinrock. Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 11:1, pages 59–73, March 1964.	May be the ﬁrst reference to the round-robin scheduling algorithm; certainly one of the ﬁrst analyses of said approach to scheduling a time-shared system.
7	[O45]	Animal Farm 	George Orwell. Secker and Warburg (London), 1945.	A great but depressing allegorical book about power and its corruptions. Some say it is a critique of Stalin and the pre-WWII Stalin era in the U.S.S.R; we say it’s a critique of pigs.
7	[CK68]	Computer Scheduling Methods and their Countermeasures 	Edward G. Coffman and Leonard Kleinrock. AFIPS ’68 (Spring), April 1968.	An excellent early introduction to and analysis of a number of basic scheduling disciplines.
7	[PV56]	Machine Repair as a Priority Waiting-Line Problem 	Thomas E. Phipps Jr., W. R. Van Voorhis. Operations Research, 4:1, pages 76–86, February 1956.	Follow-on work that generalizes the SJF approach to machine repair from Cobham’s original work; also postulates the utility of an STCF approach in such an environment. Speciﬁcally, There are certain types of repair work, ... involving much dismantling and covering the ﬂoor with nuts and bolts, which certainly should not be interrupted once undertaken; in other cases it would be inadvisable to continue work on a long job if one or more short ones became available (p.81).”
7	[C54]	Priority Assignment in Waiting Line Problems 	A. Cobham. Journal of Operations Research, 2:70, pages 70–76, 1954.	The pioneering paper on using an SJF approach in scheduling the repair of machines.
7	[J91]	The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling 	R. Jain. Interscience, New York, April 1991.	The standard text on computer systems measurement. A great reference for your library, for sure.
7	[B+79]	The Convoy Phenomenon 	M. Blasgen, J. Gray, M. Mitoma, T. Price. ACM Operating Systems Review, 13:2, April 1979.	Perhaps the ﬁrst reference to convoys, which occurs in databases as well as the OS.
7	[MB91]	The effect of context switches on cache performance 	Jeffrey C. Mogul, Anita Borg. ASPLOS, 1991.	A nice study on how cache performance can be affected by context switching; less of an issue in today’s systems where processors issue billions of instructions per second but context-switches still happen in the millisecond time range.
7	[W15]	You can’t have your cake and eat it 	Authors: Unknown.. Wikipedia (as of December 2015). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You can’t have your cake and eat it.	The best part of this page is reading all the similar idioms from other languages. In Tamil, you can’t have both the moustache and drink the soup.”
8	[E95]	An Analysis of Decay-Usage Scheduling in Multiprocessors 	D.H.J. Epema. SIGMETRICS ’95.	A nice paper on the state of the art of scheduling back in the mid 1990s, including a good overview of the basic approach behind decay-usage schedulers.
8	[C+62]	An Experimental Time-Sharing System 	F. J. Corbato, M. M. Daggett, R. C. Daley. IFIPS 1962.	A bit hard to read, but the source of many of the ﬁrst ideas in multi-level feedback scheduling. Much of this later went into Multics, which one could argue was the most inﬂuential operating system of all time.
8	[P+95]	Informed Prefetching and Caching 	R.H. Patterson, G.A. Gibson, E. Ginting, D. Stodolsky, J. Zelenka. SOSP ’95, Copper Mountain, Colorado, October 1995.	A fun paper about some very cool ideas in ﬁle systems, including how applications can give the OS advice about what ﬁles it is accessing and how it plans to access them.
8	[CS97]	Inside Windows NT 	Helen Custer and David A. Solomon. Microsoft Press, 1997.	The NT book, if you want to learn about something other than U NIX. Of course, why would you? OK, we’re kidding; you might actually work for Microsoft some day you know.
8	[O11]	John Ousterhout’s Home Page 	John Ousterhout. www.stanford.edu/~ouster/. 	The home page of the famous Professor Ousterhout. The two co-authors of this book had the pleasure of taking graduate operating systems from Ousterhout while in graduate school; indeed, this is where the two co-authors got to know each other, eventually leading to marriage, kids, and even this book. Thus, you really can blame Ousterhout for this entire mess you’re in.
8	[AD00]	Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling in Solaris 	Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. Available: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/notes-solaris.pdf. 	A great short set of notes by one of the authors on the details of the Solaris scheduler. OK, we are probably biased in this description, but the notes are pretty darn good.

Another OS classic, written by four of the main people behind BSD. The later versions of this book, while more up to date, don’t quite match the beauty of this one.
8	[B86]	The Design of the U NIX Operating System 	M.J. Bach. Prentice-Hall, 1986.	One of the classic old books on how a real U NIX operating system is built; a deﬁnite must-read for kernel hackers.
9	[KL88]	A Fair Share Scheduler 	J. Kay and P. Lauder. CACM, Volume 31 Issue 1, January 1988.	An early reference to a fair-share scheduler.
9	[AC97]	Extending Proportional-Share Scheduling to a Network of Workstations 	Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau and David E. Culler. PDPTA’97, June 1997.	A paper by one of the authors on how to extend proportional-share scheduling to work better in a clustered environment.
9	[J09]	Inside The Linux 2.6 Completely Fair Scheduler	M. Tim Jones. December 15, 2009. http://ostep.org/Citations/inside-cfs.pdf.	A simple overview of CFS from its earlier days. CFS was created by Ingo Molnar in a short burst of creativity which led to a 100K kernel patch developed in 62 hours.

The award-winning thesis of Waldspurger’s that outlines lottery and stride scheduling. If you’re thinking of writing a Ph.D. dissertation at some point, you should always have a good example around, to give you something to strive for: this is such a good one.
9	[WW94]	Lottery Scheduling: Flexible Proportional-Share Resource Management 	Carl A. Waldspurger and William E. Weihl. OSDI ’94, November 1994.	The landmark paper on lottery scheduling that got the systems community re-energized about scheduling, fair sharing, and the power of simple randomized algorithms.
9	[W02]	Memory Resource Management in VMware ESX Server 	Carl A. Waldspurger. OSDI ’02, Boston, Massachusetts.	he paper to read about memory management in VMMs (a.k.a., hypervisors).

9	[K+15]	Proﬁling A Warehouse-scale Computer 	S. Kanev, P. Ranganathan, J. P. Darago, K. Hazelwood, T. Moseley, G. Wei, D. Brooks. ISCA ’15, June, 2015, Portland, Oregon.	A fascinating study of where the cycles go in modern data centers, which are increasingly where most of computing happens. Almost 20% of CPU time is spent in the operating system, 5% in the scheduler alone!
9	[B72]	Symmetric binary B-Trees: Data Structure And Maintenance Algorithms 	Rudolf Bayer. Acta Informatica, Volume 1, Number 4, December 1972.	A cool balanced tree introduced before you were born (most likely). One of many balanced trees out there; study your algorithms book for more alternatives!

USENIX ATC ’18, July 2018, Boston, Massachusetts.	A recent, detailed work comparing Linux CFS and the FreeBSD schedulers. An excellent overview of each scheduler is also provided. The result of the comparison: inconclusive (in some cases CFS was better, and in others, ULE (the BSD scheduler), was. Sometimes in life there are no easy answers.
9	[D82]	Why Numbering Should Start At Zero 	Edsger Dijkstra, August 1982. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD831.PDF.	A short note from E. Dijkstra, one of the pioneers of computer science. We’ll be hearing much more on this guy in the section on Concurrency. In the meanwhile, enjoy this note, which includes this motivating quote:  One of my colleagues — not a computing scientist — accused a number of younger computing scientists of ’pedantry’ because they started numbering at zero.” The note explains why doing so is logical.
10	[SHW11]	A Primer on Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence 	Daniel J. Sorin, Mark D. Hill, and David A. Wood. Synthesis Lectures in Computer Architecture. Morgan and Claypool Publishers, May 2011.

Technical Report TR-95-22, Old Dominion University, 1996.	A tech report on this cool scheduling idea, from Ion Stoica, now a professor at U.C. Berkeley and world expert in networking, distributed systems, and many other things.
10	[TTG95]	Evaluating the Performance of Cache-Afﬁnity Scheduling in Shared-Memory Multiprocessors 	Josep Torrellas, Andrew Tucker, Anoop Gupta. Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Volume 24:2, February 1995.	This is not the ﬁrst paper on the topic, but it has citations to earlier work, and is a more readable and practical paper than some of the earlier queuingbased analysis papers.
10	[CSG99]	Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach 	David E. Culler, Jaswinder Pal Singh, and Anoop Gupta. Morgan Kaufmann, 1999.	A treasure ﬁlled with details about parallel machines and algorithms. As Mark Hill humorously observes on the jacket, the book contains more information than most research papers.
10	[FLR98]	The Implementation of the Cilk-5 Multithreaded Language	Matteo Frigo, Charles E. Leiserson, Keith Randall. PLDI ’98, Montreal, Canada, June 1998.	Cilk is a lightweight language and runtime for writing parallel programs, and an excellent example of the work-stealing paradigm.
10	[A90]	The Performance of Spin Lock Alternatives for Shared-Memory Multiprocessors 	Thomas E. Anderson. IEEE TPDS Volume 1:1, January 1990.	A classic paper on how different locking alternatives do and don’t scale. By Tom Anderson, very well known researcher in both systems and networking. And author of a very ﬁne OS textbook, we must say.
10	[M11]	Towards Transparent CPU Scheduling 	Joseph T. Meehean. Doctoral Dissertation at University of Wisconsin—Madison, 2011.	A dissertation that covers a lot of the details of how modern Linux multiprocessor scheduling works. Pretty awesome! But, as co-advisors of Joe’s, we may be a bit biased here.
10	[G83]	Using Cache Memory To Reduce Processor-Memory Trafﬁc 	James R. Goodman. ISCA ’83, Stockholm, Sweden, June 1983.	The pioneering paper on how to use bus snooping, i.e., paying attention to requests you see on the bus, to build a cache coherence protocol. Goodman’s research over many years at Wisconsin is full of cleverness, this being but one example.
13	[M+63]	A Time-Sharing Debugging System for a Small Computer 	J. McCarthy, S. Boilen, E. Fredkin, J. C. R. Licklider. AFIPS ’63 (Spring), New York, NY, May 1963.

13	[CV65]	Introduction and Overview of the Multics System 	F. J. Corbato, V. A. Vyssotsky. Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1965.	A great early Multics paper. Here is the great quote about time sharing: The impetus for time-sharing ﬁrst arose from professional programmers because of their constant frustration in debugging programs at batch processing installations. Thus, the original goal was to time-share computers to allow simultaneous access by several persons while giving to each of them the illusion of having the whole machine at his disposal.”
13	[R+89]	Mach: A System Software kernel 	R. Rashid, D. Julin, D. Orr, R. Sanzi, R. Baron, A. Forin, D. Golub, M. Jones. COMPCON ’89, February 1989.

13	[L60]	Man-Computer Symbiosis 	J. C. R. Licklider. IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics, HFE-1:1, March 1960.	A funky paper about how computers and people are going to enter into a symbiotic age; clearly well ahead of its time but a fascinating read nonetheless.
13	[DV66]	Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations 	Jack B. Dennis, Earl C. Van Horn. Communications of the ACM, Volume 9, Number 3, March 1966.	An early paper (but not the ﬁrst) on multiprogramming.
13	[M83]	Reminiscences on the History of Time Sharing 	John McCarthy. 1983. Available: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html.	A terriﬁc historical note on where the idea of time-sharing might have come fzshortm, including some doubts towards those who cite Strachey’s work [S59] as the by pioneering work in this area..

14	[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005.	We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: read this book many times and use it as a reference whenever you are in doubt. The authors are always surprised at how each time they read something in this book, they learn something new, even after many years of C programming.

The paper sparked renewed interest in software techniques for isolation of memory references.
15	[W17] Answer to footnote:	Is there anything other than havoc that can be wreaked?	Waciuma Wanjohi. October 2017.	Amazingly, this enterprising reader found the answer via google’s Ngram viewing tool (available at the following URL: http://books.google.com/ngrams). The answer, thanks to Mr. Wanjohi It’s only since about 1970 that ’wreak havoc’ has been more popular than ’wreak vengeance’. In the 1800s, the word wreak was almost always followed by ’his/their vengeance’.” Apparently, when you wreak, you are up to no good, but at least wreakers have some options now.
15	[M65]	On Dynamic Program Relocation	W.C. McGee. IBM Systems Journal, Volume 4:3, 1965, pages 184–199.	This paper is a nice summary of early work on dynamic relocation, as well as some basics on static relocation.

15	[SS74]	The Protection of Information in Computer Systems	J. Saltzer and M. Schroeder. CACM, July 1974.	From this paper: The concepts of base-and-bound register and hardware-interpreted descriptors appeared, apparently independently, between 1957 and 1959 on three projects with diverse goals. At M.I.T., McCarthy suggested the base-and-bound idea as part of the memory protection system necessary to make time-sharing feasible. IBM independently developed the base-and-bound register as a mechanism to permit reliable multiprogramming of the Stretch (7030) computer system. At Burroughs, R. Barton suggested that hardware-interpreted descriptors would provide direct support for the naming scope rules of higher level languages in the B5000 computer system.” We found this quote on Mark Smotherman’s cool history pages [S04]; see them for more information.

16	[I09]	Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manuals	Intel. 2009. Available: http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals.	Try reading about segmentation in here (Chapter 3 in Volume 3a); it’ll hurt your head, at least a little bit.
16	[CV65]	Introduction and Overview of the Multics System	F. J. Corbato, V. A. Vyssotsky. 	Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1965. One of ﬁve papers presented on Multics at the Fall Joint Computer Conference; oh to be a ﬂy on the wall in that room that day!
16	[H61]	Program Organization and Record Keeping for Dynamic Storage	A. W. Holt. Communications of the ACM, Volume 4:10, October 1961.	An incredibly early and difﬁcult to read paper about segmentation and some of its uses.
16	[K68]	The Art of Computer Programming: Volume I	Donald Knuth. Addison-Wesley, 1968.	Knuth is famous not only for his early books on the Art of Computer Programming but for his typesetting system TeX which is still a powerhouse typesetting tool used by professionals today, and indeed to typeset this very book. His tomes on algorithms are a great early reference to many of the algorithms that underly computing systems today.
16	[LL82]	Virtual Memory Management in the VAX/VMS Operating System	Henry M. Levy, Peter H. Lipman. IEEE Computer, Volume 15:3, March 1982.	A classic memory management system, with lots of common sense in its design. We’ll study it in more detail in a later chapter.
16	[DD68]	Virtual Memory, Processes, and Sharing in Multics	Robert C. Daley and Jack B. Dennis. Communications of the ACM, Volume 11:5, May 1968.	An early paper on how to perform dynamic linking in Multics, which was way ahead of its time. Dynamic linking ﬁnally found its way back into systems about 20 years later, as the large X-windows libraries demanded it. Some say that these large X11 libraries were MIT’s revenge for removing support for dynamic linking in early versions of U NIX!
17	[K65]	A Fast Storage Allocator	Kenneth C. Knowlton. Communications of the ACM, Volume 8:10, October 1965.	The common reference for buddy allocation. Random strange fact: Knuth gives credit for the idea not to Knowlton but to Harry Markowitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist. Another strange fact: Knuth communicates all of his emails via a secretary; he doesn’t send email himself, rather he tells his secretary what email to send and then the secretary does the work of emailing. Last Knuth fact: he created TeX, the tool used to typeset this book. It is an amazing piece of software 4.

McGraw-Hill, New York, 1971.	The Atlas pioneered the idea of dividing memory into ﬁxed-sized pages and in many senses was an early form of the memory-management ideas we see in modern computer systems.
18	[L78]	The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A Historical Perspective	S. H. Lavington. Communications of the ACM, Volume 21:1, January 1978.	This paper is a great retrospective of some of the history of the development of some important computer systems. As we sometimes forget in the US, many of these new ideas came from overseas.

Technical Report No. UCB/CSD-92-684, February 1992..	A great dissertation about how to predict execution time of applications by breaking them down into constituent pieces and knowing the cost of each piece. Probably the most interesting part that comes out of this work is the tool to measure details of the cache hierarchy (described in Chapter 5). Make sure to check out the wonderful diagrams therein.

19	[PS81]	RISC-I: A Reduced Instruction Set VLSI Computer	D.A. Patterson and C.H. Sequin. ISCA ’81, Minneapolis, May 1981.	The paper that introduced the term RISC, and started the avalanche of research into simplifying computer chips for performance.
19	[CG68]	Shared-access Data Processing System	John F. Couleur, Edward L. Glaser. Patent 3412382, November 1968.	The patent that contains the idea for an associative memory to store address translations. The idea, according to Couleur, came in 1964.
19	[CP78]	The architecture of the IBM System/370	R.P. Case, A. Padegs. Communications of the ACM. 21:1, 73-96, January 1978.	Perhaps the ﬁrst paper to use the term translation lookaside buffer. The name arises from the historical name for a cache, which was a lookaside buffer as called by those developing the Atlas system at the University of Manchester; a cache of address translations thus became a translation lookaside buffer. Even though the term lookaside buffer fell out of favor, TLB seems to have stuck, for whatever reason.
19	[C95]	The Core of the Black Canyon Computer Corporation	John Couleur. IEEE Annals of History of Computing, 17:4, 1995.	In this fascinating historical note, Couleur talks about how he invented the TLB in 1964 while working for GE, and the fortuitous collaboration that thus ensued with the Project MAC folks at MIT.

20	[BOH10]	Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective	Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron. Addison-Wesley, 2010.	We have yet to ﬁnd a good ﬁrst reference to the multi-level page table. However, this great textbook by Bryant and O’Hallaron dives into the details of x86, which at least is an early system that used such structures. It’s also just a great book to have.
20	[M07]	Multics: History	Available: http://www.multicians.org/history.html. 	This amazing web site provides a huge amount of history on the Multics system, certainly one of the most inﬂuential systems in OS history.

20	[M28]	Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups	Mars Candy Corporation. Published at stores near you. 	Apparently these ﬁne confections were invented in 1928 by Harry Burnett Reese, a former dairy farmer and shipping foreman for one Milton S. Hershey. At least, that is what it says on Wikipedia. If true, Hershey and Reese probably hate each other’s guts, as any two chocolate barons should.

21	[CS94]	Take Our Word For it 	F. Corbato, R. Steinberg. www.takeourword.com/TOW146 (Page 4).	Richard Steinberg writes: Someone has asked me the origin of the word daemon as it applies to computing. Best I can tell based on my research, the word was ﬁrst used by people on your team at Project MAC using the IBM 7094 in 1963.” Professor Corbato replies: Our use of the word daemon was inspired by the Maxwell’s daemon of physics and thermodynamics (my background is in physics). Maxwell’s daemon was an imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background. We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform system chores.”
21	[LL82]	Virtual Memory Management in the VAX/VMS Operating System	Hank Levy, P. Lipman. IEEE Computer, Vol. 15, No. 3, March 1982.	Not the ﬁrst place where page clustering was used, but a clear and simple explanation of how such a mechanism works. We sure cite this paper a lot!

22	[FP89]	Electrochemically Induced Nuclear Fusion of Deuterium	Martin Fleischmann, Stanley Pons. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, Volume 26, Number 2, Part 1, April, 1989.	The famous paper that would have revolutionized the world in providing an easy way to generate nearly-inﬁnite power from jars of water with a little metal in them. Unfortunately, the results published (and widely publicized) by Pons and Fleischmann were impossible to reproduce, and thus these two well-meaning scientists were discredited (and certainly, mocked). The only guy really happy about this result was Marvin Hawkins, whose name was left off this paper even though he participated in the work, thus avoiding association with one of the biggest scientiﬁc goofs of the 20th century.
22	[M+70]	Evaluation Techniques for Storage Hierarchies	R. L. Mattson, J. Gecsei, D. R. Slutz, I. L. Traiger. IBM Systems Journal, Volume 9:2, 1970.	A paper that is mostly about how to simulate cache hierarchies efﬁciently; certainly a classic in that regard, as well for its excellent discussion of some of the properties of various replacement algorithms. Can you ﬁgure out why the stack property might be useful for simulating a lot of different-sized caches at once?
22	[KE+62]	One-level Storage System	T. Kilburn, D.B.G. Edwards, M.J. Lanigan, F.H. Sumner. IRE Trans. EC-11:2, 1962.	Although Atlas had a use bit, it only had a very small number of pages, and thus the scanning of the use bits in large memories was not a problem the authors solved.

23	[M04]	Cloud Atlas	D. Mitchell. Random House, 2004.	It’s hard to pick a favorite book. There are too many! Each is great in its own unique way. But it’d be hard for these authors not to pick Cloud Atlas”, a fantastic, sprawling epic about the human condition, from where the the last quote of this chapter is lifted. If you are smart – and we think you are – you should stop reading obscure commentary in the references and instead read Cloud Atlas”; you’ll thank us later.

26	[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005.	As we’ve said many times, buy this book, and read it, in little chunks, preferably before going to bed.

26	[L+93]	Atomic Transactions	Nancy Lynch, Michael Merritt, William Weihl, Alan Fekete. Morgan Kaufmann, August 1993.	A nice text on some of the theory and practice of atomic transactions for distributed systems. Perhaps a bit formal for some, but lots of good material is found herein.
26	[D68]	Cooperating sequential processes	Edsger W. Dijkstra. 1968. Available at this site: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD123.PDF.	Dijkstra has an amazing number of his old papers, notes, and thoughts recorded (for posterity) on this website at the last place he worked, the University of Texas. Much of his foundational work, however, was done years earlier while he was at the Technische Hochshule of Eindhoven (THE), including this famous paper on "cooperating sequential processes”, which basically outlines all of the thinking that has to go into writing multi-threaded programs. Dijkstra discovered much of this while working on an operating system named after his school: the "THE" operating system (said "T", "H", "E", and not like the word "the”).
26	[D65]	Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control	E. W. Dijkstra. Communications of the ACM, 8(9):569, September 1965.	Pointed to as the ﬁrst paper of Dijkstra’s where he outlines the mutual exclusion problem and a solution. The solution, however, is not widely used; advanced hardware and OS support is needed, as we will see in the coming chapters.
26	[GR92]	Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques	Jim Gray and Andreas Reuter. Morgan Kaufmann, September 1992.	This book is the bible of transaction processing, written by one of the legends of the ﬁeld, Jim Gray. It is, for this reason, also considered Jim Gray’s brain dump”, in which he wrote down everything he knows about how database management systems work. Sadly, Gray passed away tragically a few years back, and many of us lost a friend and great mentor, including the co-authors of said book, who were lucky enough to interact with Gray during their graduate school years.
26	[NM92]	What Are Race Conditions? Some Issues and Formalizations	Robert H. B. Netzer and Barton P. Miller. ACM Letters on Programming Languages and Systems, Volume 1:1, March 1992.	An excellent discussion of the different types of races found in concurrent programs. In this chapter (and the next few), we focus on data races, but later we will broaden to discuss general races as well.
27	[X+10]	Ad Hoc Synchronization Considered Harmful	Weiwei Xiong, Soyeon Park, Jiaqi Zhang, Yuanyuan Zhou, Zhiqiang Ma. OSDI 2010, Vancouver, Canada.	This paper shows how seemingly simple synchronization code can lead to a surprising number of bugs. Use condition variables and do the signaling correctly!
27	[B89]	An Introduction to Programming with Threads	Andrew D. Birrell. DEC Technical Report, January, 1989. Available: https://birrell.org/andrew/papers/035-Threads.pdf	A classic but older introduction to threaded programming. Still a worthwhile read, and freely available.
27	[B97]	Programming with POSIX Threads	David R. Butenhof. Addison-Wesley, May 1997.	Another one of these books on threads.
27	[K+96]	Programming With Threads	Steve Kleiman, Devang Shah, Bart Smaalders. Prentice Hall, January 1996.	Probably one of the better books in this space. Get it at your local library. Or steal it from your mother. More seriously, just ask your mother for it – she’ll let you borrow it, don’t worry.
27	[B+96]	PThreads Programming: by A POSIX Standard for Better Multiprocessing.	Dick Buttlar, Jacqueline Farrell, Bradford Nichols. O’Reilly, September 1996	A reasonable book from the excellent, practical publishing house O’Reilly. Our bookshelves certainly contain a great deal of books from this company, including some excellent offerings on Perl, Python, and Javascript (particularly Crockford’s Javascript: The Good Parts”.)
28	[MS91]	Algorithms for Scalable Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors	John M. Mellor-Crummey and M. L. Scott. ACM TOCS, Volume 9, Issue 1, February 1991.	An excellent and thorough survey on different locking algorithms. However, no operating systems support is used, just fancy hardware instructions.
28	[D68]	Cooperating sequential processes	Edsger W. Dijkstra. 1968. Available online here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD123.PDF.	One of the early seminal papers. Discusses how Dijkstra posed the original concurrency problem, and Dekker’s solution.
28	[D+13]	Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask	Tudor David, Rachid Guerraoui, Vasileios Trigonakis. SOSP ’13, Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, Pennsylvania, November 2013.	An excellent paper comparing many different ways to build locks using hardware primitives. Great to see how many ideas work on modern hardware.
28	[L09]	glibc 2.9 (include Linux pthreads implementation)	Many authors.. Available here: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc. 	In particular, take a look at the nptl subdirectory where you will ﬁnd most of the pthread support in Linux today.
28	[S05]	Guide to porting from Solaris to Linux on x86	Ajay Sood, April 29, 2005. Available: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-solar/.	
28	[D91]	Just Win, Baby: Al Davis and His Raiders	Glenn Dickey. Harcourt, 1991.	The book about Al Davis and his famous quote. Or, we suppose, the book is more about Al Davis and the Raiders, and not so much the quote. To be clear: we are not recommending this book, we just needed a citation.
28	[W09]	Load-Link, Store-Conditional	Many authors.. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoadLink/Store-Conditional. 	Can you believe we referenced Wikipedia? But, we found the information there and it felt wrong not to. Further, it was useful, listing the instructions for the different architectures: ldl l/stl c and ldq l/stq c (Alpha), lwarx/stwcx (PowerPC), ll/sc (MIPS), and ldrex/strex (ARM). Actually Wikipedia is pretty amazing, so don’t be so harsh, OK?
28	[H93]	MIPS R4000 Microprocessor User’s Manual	Joe Heinrich. Prentice-Hall, June 1993. Available: http://cag.csail.mit.edu/raw/documents/R4400 Uman book Ed2.pdf.	The old MIPS user’s manual. Download it while it still exists.

28	[L81]	Observations on the Development of an Operating System	Hugh Lauer. SOSP ’81, Paciﬁc Grove, California, December 1981.	A must-read retrospective about the development of the Pilot OS, an early PC operating system. Fun and full of insights.
28	[S09]	OpenSolaris Thread Library	Sun.. Code: src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/ onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/lib/libc/port/threads/synch.c. 	Pretty interesting, although who knows what will happen now that Oracle owns Sun. Thanks to Mike Swift for the pointer.
28	[M15]	OSSpinLock Is Unsafe	J. McCall. mjtsai.com/blog/2015/12/16/osspinlock -is-unsafe.	Calling OSSpinLock on a Mac is unsafe when using threads of different priorities – you might spin forever! So be careful, Mac fanatics, even your mighty system can be less than perfect...
28	[M82]	The Architecture of the Burroughs B5000: 20 Years Later and Still Ahead of the Times?	A. Mayer. 1982. Available: www.ajwm.net/amayer/papers/B5000.html.	It (RDLK) is an indivisible operation which reads from and writes into a memory location.” RDLK is thus testand-set! Dave Dahm created spin locks (“Buzz Locks”) and a two-phase lock called Dahm Locks.”
28	[WG00]	The SPARC Architecture Manual: Version 9	D. Weaver, T. Germond. SPARC International, 2000. http://www.sparc.org/standards/SPARCV9.pdf.	See developers. sun.com/solaris/articles/atomic sparc/ for more on atomics.
28	[H91]	Wait-free Synchronization	Maurice Herlihy. ACM TOPLAS, Volume 13: 1, January 1991.	A landmark paper introducing a different approach to building concurrent data structures. Because of the complexity involved, some of these ideas have been slow to gain acceptance in deployment.
28	[R97]	What Really Happened on Mars?	Glenn E. Reeves. research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/mbj/Mars Pathfinder/Authoritative Account.html. 	A description of priority inversion on Mars Pathﬁnder. Concurrent code correctness matters, especially in space!
29	[L+13]	A Study of Linux File System Evolution	Lanyue Lu, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, Shan Lu. FAST ’13, San Jose, CA, February 2013.	Our paper that studies every patch to Linux ﬁle systems over nearly a decade. Lots of fun ﬁndings in there; read it to see! The work was painful to do though; the poor graduate student, Lanyue Lu, had to look through every single patch by hand in order to understand what they did.
29	[B+10]	An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores	Silas Boyd-Wickizer, Austin T. Clements, Yandong Mao, Aleksey Pesterev, M. Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich . OSDI ’10, Vancouver, Canada, October 2010.	A great study of how Linux performs on multicore machines, as well as some simple solutions. Includes a neat sloppy counter to solve one form of the scalable counting problem.
29	[MS04]	Concurrent Data Structures	Mark Moir and Nir Shavit. In Handbook of Data Structures and Applications (Editors D. Metha and S.Sahni). Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2004. Available: www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shanir/concurrent-data-structures.pdf.	A short but relatively comprehensive reference on concurrent data structures. Though it is missing some of the latest works in the area (due to its age), it remains an incredibly useful reference.
29	[S+11]	Making the Common Case the Only Case with Anticipatory Memory Allocation	Swaminathan Sundararaman, Yupu Zhang, Sriram Subramanian, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau . FAST ’11, San Jose, CA, February 2011.	Our work on removing possibly-failing allocation calls from kernel code paths. By allocating all potentially needed memory before doing any work, we avoid failure deep down in the storage stack.
29	[MS98]	Nonblocking Algorithms and Preemption-safe Locking on by Multiprogrammed Shared-memory Multiprocessors.	M. Michael, M. Scott. Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Vol. 51, No. 1, 1998	Professor Scott and his students have been at the forefront of concurrent algorithms and data structures for many years; check out his web page, numerous papers, or books to ﬁnd out more.
29	[BH73]	Operating System Principles	Per Brinch Hansen. Prentice-Hall, 1973. Available: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=540365.	One of the ﬁrst books on operating systems; certainly ahead of its time. Introduced monitors as a concurrency primitive.
29	[MM00]	Solaris Internals: Core Kernel Architecture	Jim Mauro and Richard McDougall. Prentice Hall, October 2000.	The Solaris book. You should also read this, if you want to learn about something other than Linux.
29	[C06]	The Search For Fast, Scalable Counters	Jonathan Corbet. February 1, 2006. Available: https://lwn.net/Articles/170003.	LWN has many wonderful articles about the latest in Linux This article is a short description of scalable approximate counting; read it, and others, to learn more about the latest in Linux.
29	[BC05]	Understanding the Linux Kernel (Third Edition)	Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati. O’Reilly Media, November 2005.	The classic book on the Linux kernel. You should read it.
30	[O49]	1984	George Orwell. Secker and Warburg, 1949.	A little heavy-handed, but of course a must read. That said, we kind of gave away the ending by quoting the last sentence. Sorry! And if the government is reading this, let us just say that we think that the government is "double plus good”. Hear that, our pals at the NSA?
30	[D68]	Cooperating sequential processes	Edsger W. Dijkstra. 1968. Available online here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD123.PDF.	Another classic from Dijkstra; reading his early works on concurrency will teach you much of what you need to know.
30	[LR80]	Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa	B.W. Lampson, D.R. Redell. Communications of the ACM. 23:2, pages 105-117, February 1980.	A terriﬁc paper about how to actually implement signaling and condition variables in a real system, leading to the term "Mesa" semantics for what it mzshortns to be woken up; the older semantics, developed by Tony Hoare [H74], then became known as "Hoare" semantics, which is hard to say out loud in class with a straight face.
30	[D72]	Information Streams Sharing a Finite Buffer	E.W. Dijkstra. Information Processing Letters 1: 179180, 1972. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD329.PDF	The famous paper that introduced the producer/consumer problem.
30	[H74]	Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept	C.A.R. Hoare. Communications of the ACM, 17:10, pages 549–557, October 1974.	Hoare did a fair amount of theoretical work in concurrency. However, he is still probably most known for his work on Quicksort, the coolest sorting algorithm in the world, at least according to these authors.
30	[D01]	My recollections of operating system design	E.W. Dijkstra. April, 2001. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd13xx/EWD1303.PDF.	A fascinating read for those of you interested in how the pioneers of our ﬁeld came up with some very basic and fundamental concepts, including ideas like "interrupts" and even a stack”!
30	[L11]	Pthread cond signal Man Page	Mysterious author. March, 2011. Available online: http://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread cond signal.	The Linux man page shows a nice simple example of why a thread might get a spurious wakeup, due to race conditions within the signal/wakeup code.
31	[D59]	A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs	E. W. Dijkstra. Numerische Mathematik 1, 269–271, 1959. Available: http://www-m3.ma.tum.de/twiki/pub/MN0506/ WebHome/dijkstra.pdf.	Can you believe people worked on algorithms in 1959? We can’t. Even before computers were any fun to use, these people had a sense that they would transform the world...
31	[H87]	Aspects of Cache Memory and Instruction Buffer Performance	Mark D. Hill. Ph.D. Dissertation, U.C. Berkeley, 1987.	Hill’s dissertation work, for those obsessed with caching in early systems. A great example of a quantitative dissertation.
31	[CHP71]	Concurrent Control with Readers and Writers	P.J. Courtois, F. Heymans, D.L. Parnas. Communications of the ACM, 14:10, October 1971.	The introduction of the reader-writer problem, and a simple solution. Later work introduced more complex solutions, skipped here because, well, they are pretty complex.
31	[D68a]	Go-to Statement Considered Harmful	E.W. Dijkstra. CACM, volume 11(3), March 1968. http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF.	Sometimes thought of as the beginning of the ﬁeld of software engineering.
31	[D71]	Hierarchical ordering of sequential processes	E.W. Dijkstra. Available online here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD310.PDF.	Presents numerous concurrency problems, including Dining Philosophers. The wikipedia page about this problem is also useful.
31	[L83]	Hints for Computer Systems Design	Butler Lampson. ACM Operating Systems Review, 15:5, October 1983.	Lampson, a famous systems researcher, loved using hints in the design of computer systems. A hint is something that is often correct but can be wrong; in this use, a signal() is telling a waiting thread that it changed the condition that the waiter was waiting on, but not to trust that the condition will be in the desired state when the waiting thread wakes up. In this paper about hints for designing systems, one of Lampson’s general hints is that you should use hints. It is not as confusing as it sounds.
31	[B04]	Implementing Condition Variables with Semaphores	Andrew Birrell. December 2004.	An interesting read on how difﬁcult implementing CVs on top of semaphores really is, and the mistakes the author and co-workers made along the way. Particularly relevant because the group had done a ton of concurrent programming; Birrell, for example, is known for (among other things) writing various thread-programming guides.
31	[D72]	Information Streams Sharing a Finite Buffer	E.W. Dijkstra. Information Processing Letters 1, 1972. http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD329.PDF.	Did Dijkstra invent everything? No, but maybe close. He certainly was the ﬁrst to clearly write down what the problems were in concurrent code. However, practitioners in OS design knew of many of the problems described by Dijkstra, so perhaps giving him too much credit would be a misrepresentation.
31	[T99]	Re: NT kernel guy playing with Linux	Linus Torvalds. June 27, 1999. Available: https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/semaphores.html.	A response from Linus himself about the utility of semaphores, including the throttling case we mention in the text. As always, Linus is slightly insulting but quite informative.
31	[CB08]	Real-world Concurrency	Bryan Cantrill, Jeff Bonwick. ACM Queue. Volume 6, No. 5. September 2008.	A nice article by some kernel hackers from a company formerly known as Sun on the real problems faced in concurrent code.
31	[D08]	The Little Book of Semaphores	A.B. Downey. Available at the following site: http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/. 	A nice (and free!) book about semaphores. Lots of fun problems to solve, if you like that sort of thing.
31	[D68b]	The Structure of the THE Multiprogramming System	E.W. Dijkstra. CACM, volume 11(5), 1968.	One of the earliest papers to point out that systems work in computer science is an engaging intellectual endeavor. Also argues strongly for modularity in the form of layered systems.
31	[GR92]	Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques	Jim Gray, Andreas Reuter. Morgan Kaufmann, September 1992.	The exact quote that we ﬁnd particularly humorous is found on page 485, at the top of Section 8.8: The ﬁrst multiprocessors, circa 1960, had test and set instructions ... presumably the OS implementors worked out the appropriate algorithms, although Dijkstra is generally credited with inventing semaphores many years later.” Oh, snap!
32	[H93]	A Methodology for Implementing Highly Concurrent Data Objects	Maurice Herlihy. ACM TOPLAS, 15:5, November 1993.	A nice overview of lock-free and wait-free structures. Both approaches eschew locks, but wait-free approaches are harder to realize, as they try to ensure than any operation on a concurrent structure will terminate in a ﬁnite number of steps (e.g., no unbounded looping).
32	[H01]	A Pragmatic Implementation of Non-blocking Linked-lists	Tim Harris. International Conference on Distributed Computing (DISC), 2001.	A relatively modern example of the difﬁculties of building something as simple as a concurrent linked list without locks.
32	[B+87]	Concurrency Control and Recovery in Database Systems	Philip A. Bernstein, Vassos Hadzilacos, Nathan Goodman. Addison-Wesley, 1987.	The classic text on concurrency in database management systems. As you can tell, understanding concurrency, deadlock, and other topics in the world of databases is a world unto itself. Study it and ﬁnd out for yourself.
32	[K87]	Deadlock Detection in Distributed Databases	Edgar Knapp. ACM Computing Surveys, 19:4, December 1987.	An excellent overview of deadlock detection in distributed database systems. Also points to a number of other related works, and thus is a good place to start your reading.
32	[J+08]	Deadlock Immunity: Enabling Systems To Defend Against Deadlocks	Horatiu Jula, Daniel Tralamazza, Cristian Zamﬁr, George Candea. OSDI ’08, San Diego, CA, December 2008.	An excellent recent paper on deadlocks and how to avoid getting caught in the same ones over and over again in a particular system.
32	[D64]	Een algorithme ter voorkoming van de dodelijke omarming	Edsger Dijkstra. 1964. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD108.PDF.	Indeed, not only did Dijkstra come up with a number of solutions to the deadlock problem, he was the ﬁrst to note its existence, at least in written form. However, he called it the "deadly embrace”, which (thankfully) did not catch on.
32	[L+08]	Learning from Mistakes — A Comprehensive Study on Real World Concurrency Bug Characteristics	Shan Lu, Soyeon Park, Eunsoo Seo, Yuanyuan Zhou. ASPLOS ’08, March 2008, Seattle, Washington.	The ﬁrst in-depth study of concurrency bugs in real software, and the basis for this chapter. Look at Y.Y. Zhou’s or Shan Lu’s web pages for many more interesting papers on bugs.
32	[T+94]	Linux File Memory Map Code	Linus Torvalds and many others. Available online at: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/filemap.c. 	Thanks to Michael Walﬁsh (NYU) for pointing out this precious example. The real world, as you can see in this ﬁle, can be a bit more complex than the simple clarity found in textbooks...
32	[GD02]	MapReduce: Simpliﬁed Data Processing on Large Clusters	Sanjay Ghemawhat, Jeff Dean. OSDI ’04, San Francisco, CA, October 2004.	The MapReduce paper ushered in the era of large-scale data processing, and proposes a framework for performing such computations on clusters of generally unreliable machines.
32	[K81]	Soul of a New Machine	Tracy Kidder. Backbay Books, 2000 (reprint of 1980 ver-sion).	A must-read for any systems builder or engineer, detailing the early days of how a team inside Data General (DG), led by Tom West, worked to produce a "new machine.” Kidder’s other books are also excellent, including "Mountains beyond Mountains.” Or maybe you don’t agree with us, comma?
32	[C+71]	System Deadlocks	E.G. Coffman, M.J. Elphick, A. Shoshani. ACM Computing Surveys, 3:2, June 1971.	The classic paper outlining the conditions for deadlock and how you might go about dealing with it. There are certainly some earlier papers on this topic; see the references within this paper for details.
32	[H91]	Wait-free Synchronization	Maurice Herlihy . ACM TOPLAS, 13:1, January 1991.	Herlihy’s work pioneers the ideas behind wait-free approaches to writing concurrent programs. These approaches tend to be complex and hard, often more difﬁcult than using locks correctly, probably limiting their success in the real world.
33	[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005.	Once again, we refer to the classic must-have-on-your-bookshelf book of U NIX systems programming. If there is some detail you need to know, it is in here.
33	[vB+03]	Capriccio: Scalable Threads for Internet Services	Rob von Behren, Jeremy Condit, Feng Zhou, George C. Necula, Eric Brewer. SOSP ’03, Lake George, New York, October 2003.	A paper about how to make threads work at extreme scale; a counter to all the event-based work ongoing at the time.
33	[A+02]	Cooperative Task Management Without Manual Stack Management	Atul Adya, Jon Howell, Marvin Theimer, William J. Bolosky, John R. Douceur. USENIX ATC ’02, Monterey, CA, June 2002.	This gem of a paper is the ﬁrst to clearly articulate some of the difﬁculties of event-based concurrency, and suggests some simple solutions, as well explores the even crazier idea of combining the two types of concurrency management into a single application!
33	[PDZ99]	Flash: An Efﬁcient and Portable Web Server	Vivek S. Pai, Peter Druschel, Willy Zwaenepoel. USENIX ’99, Monterey, CA, June 1999.	A pioneering paper on how to structure web servers in the then-burgeoning Internet era. Read it to understand the basics as well as to see the authors’ ideas on how to build hybrids when support for asynchronous I/O is lacking.
33	[N13]	Node.js Documentation	the folks who built node.js. Available: nodejs.org/api. 	One of the many cool new frameworks that help you readily build web services and applications. Every modern systems hacker should be proﬁcient in frameworks such as this one (and likely, more than one). Spend the time and do some development in one of these worlds and become an expert.
33	[FHK84]	Programming With Continuations	Daniel P. Friedman, Christopher T. Haynes, Eugene E. Kohlbecker. In Program Transformation and Programming Environments, Springer Verlag, 1984.	The classic reference to this old idea from the world of programming languages. Now increasingly popular in some modern languages.
33	[WCB01]	SEDA: An Architecture for Well-Conditioned, Scalable Internet Services	Matt Welsh, David Culler, and Eric Brewer. SOSP ’01, Banff, Canada, October 2001.	A nice twist on event-based serving that combines threads, queues, and event-based handling into one streamlined whole. Some of these ideas have found their way into the infrastructures of companies such as Google, Amazon, and elsewhere.
33	[O96]	Why Threads Are A Bad Idea (for most purposes)	John Ousterhout. Invited Talk at USENIX ’96, San Diego, CA, January 1996.	A great talk about how threads aren’t a great match for GUI-based applications (but the ideas are more general). Ousterhout formed many of these opinions while he was developing Tcl/Tk, a cool scripting language and toolkit that made it 100x easier to develop GUI-based applications than the state of the art at the time. While the Tk GUI toolkit lives on (in Python for example), Tcl seems to be slowly dying (unfortunately).
36	[C01]	An Empirical Study of Operating System Errors	Andy Chou, Junfeng Yang, Benjamin Chelf, Seth Hallem, Dawson Engler. SOSP ’01.	One of the ﬁrst papers to systematically explore how many bugs are in modern operating systems. Among other neat ﬁndings, the authors show that device drivers have something like seven times more bugs than mainline kernel code.
36	[L94]	AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives	Lawrence J. Lamers. Reference number: ANSI X3.221, 1994. Available: ftp://ftp.t10.org/t13/project/d0791r4c-ATA-1.pdf.	A rather dry document about device interfaces. Read it at your own peril.
36	[G08]	EIO: Error-handling is Occasionally Correct	Haryadi Gunawi, Cindy Rubio-Gonzalez, Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, Ben Liblit. FAST ’08, San Jose, CA, February 2008.	Our own work on building a tool to ﬁnd code in Linux ﬁle systems that does not handle error return properly. We found hundreds and hundreds of bugs, many of which have now been ﬁxed.
36	[MR96]	Eliminating Receive Livelock in an Interrupt-driven Kernel	Jeffrey Mogul, K. K. Ramakrishnan. USENIX ’96, San Diego, CA, January 1996.	Mogul and colleagues did a great deal of pioneering work on web server network performance. This paper is but one example.
36	[H18]	Hacker News	Many contributors. Available: https://news.ycombinator.com. One of the better aggregrators for tech-related stuff. 	Once back in 2014, this book became a highly-ranked entry, leading to 1 million chapter downloads in just one day! Sadly, we have yet to re-experience such a high.
36	[W10]	Hard Disk Driver	Washington State Course Homepage. Available online at this site: http://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/cs560/HDdriver.html.	A nice summary of a simple IDE disk drive’s interface and how to build a device driver for it.
36	[S03]	Improving the Reliability of Commodity Operating Systems	Michael M. Swift, Brian N. Bershad, Henry M. Levy. SOSP ’03.	Swift’s work revived interest in a more microkernel-like approach to operating systems; minimally, it ﬁnally gave some good reasons why address-space based protection could be useful in a modern OS.
36	[H17]	Intel Core i7-7700K review: Kaby Lake Debuts for Desktop	Joel Hruska. January 3, 2017. www.extremetech.com/extreme/241950-intels-core-i7-7700k-reviewed-kaby -lake-debuts-desktop.	An in-depth review of a recent Intel chipset, including CPUs and the I/O subsystem.
36	[S08]	Interrupts	Mark Smotherman. July ’08. Available: http://people.cs.clemson.edu/ ~mark/interrupts.html.	A treasure trove of information on the history of interrupts, DMA, and related early ideas in computing.

37	[JW91]	Disk Scheduling Algorithms Based On Rotational Position	D. Jacobson, J. Wilkes. Technical Report HPL-CSP-91-7rev1, Hewlett-Packard, February 1991.	A more modern take on disk scheduling. It remains a technical report (and not a published paper) because the authors were scooped by Seltzer et al. [S90].
37	[SCO90]	Disk Scheduling Revisited	Margo Seltzer, Peter Chen, John Ousterhout. USENIX 1990.	A paper that talks about how rotation matters too in the world of disk scheduling.

Ganger FAST ’04, pp. 87-100, 2004	While the MEMS aspect of this paper hasn’t yet made an impact, the discussion of the contract between ﬁle systems and disks is wonderful and a lasting contribution. We later build on this work to study the Unwritten Contract of Solid State Drives” [HK+17]
37	[ADR03]	More Than an Interface: SCSI vs. ATA	Dave Anderson, Jim Dykes, Erik Riedel. FAST ’03, 2003.	One of the best recent-ish references on how modern disk drives really work; a must read for anyone interested in knowing more.

We take the idea of the unwritten contract, and extend it to SSDs. Using SSDs well seems as complicated than hard drives, and sometimes more so.
38	[B+08]	An Analysis of Data Corruption in the Storage Stack	Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram, Garth R. Goodson, Bianca Schroeder, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. ArpaciDusseau. FAST ’08, San Jose, CA, February 2008.	Our own work analyzing how often disks actually corrupt your data. Not often, but sometimes! And thus something a reliable storage system must consider.
38	[S84]	Byzantine Generals in Action: Implementing Fail-Stop Processors	F.B. Schneider. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 2(2):145154, May 1984.	Finally, a paper that is not about RAID! This paper is actually about how systems fail, and how to make something behave in a fail-stop manner.
38	[BJ88]	Disk Shadowing	D. Bitton and J. Gray. VLDB 1988.	One of the ﬁrst papers to discuss mirroring, therein called "shadowing”.
38	[SG86]	Disk Striping	K. Salem, H. Garcia-Molina. IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 1986.	And yes, another early RAID work. There are a lot of these, which kind of came out of the woodwork when the RAID paper was published in SIGMOD.

38	[P+88]	Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks	D. Patterson, G. Gibson, R. Katz. SIGMOD 1988. This is considered the RAID paper, written by famous authors Patterson, Gibson, and Katz.	The paper has since won many test-of-time awards and ushered in the RAID era, including the name RAID itself!
38	[C+04]	Row-Diagonal Parity for Double Disk Failure Correction	P. Corbett, B. English, A. Goel, T. Grcanac, S. Kleiman, J. Leong, S. Sankar. FAST ’04, February 2004.	Though not the ﬁrst paper on a RAID system with two disks for parity, it is a recent and highly-understandable version of said idea. Read it to learn more.

39	[MJLF84]	A Fast File System for UNIX	Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Sam J. Lefﬂer, Robert S. Fabry. ACM TOCS, 2:3, August 1984.	We’ll talk about the Fast File System (FFS) explicitly later on. Here, we refer to it because of all the other random fun things it introduced, like long ﬁle names and symbolic links. Sometimes, when you are building a system to improve one thing, you improve a lot of other things along the way.
39	[SR05]	Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment	W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. Addison-Wesley, 2005.	We have probably referenced this book a few hundred thousand times. It is that useful to you, if you care to become an awesome systems programmer.

Pillai, Vijay Chidambaram, Ramnatthan Alagappan, Samer Al-Kiswany, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, and Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. OSDI ’14, Broomﬁeld, Colorado, October 2014.	The full conference paper on this topic – with many more details and interesting tidbits than the ﬁrst workshop paper above.
39	[L84]	Capability-Based Computer Systems	Henry M. Levy. Digital Press, 1984. Available: http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~levy/capabook.	An excellent overview of early capability-based systems.

39	[SK09]	Principles of Computer System Design	Jerome H. Saltzer and M. Frans Kaashoek. Morgan-Kaufmann, 2009.	This tour de force of systems is a must-read for anybody interested in the ﬁeld. It’s how they teach systems at MIT. Read it once, and then read it a few more times to let it all soak in.
39	[K84]	Processes as Files	Tom J. Killian. USENIX, June 1984.	The paper that introduced the /proc ﬁle system, where each process can be treated as a ﬁle within a pseudo ﬁle system. A clever idea that you can still see in modern U NIX systems.
39	[CK+08]	The xv6 Operating System	Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich. From: https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.	As mentioned before, a cool and simple Unix implementation. We have been using an older version (2012-01-30-1-g1c41342) and hence some examples in the book may not match the latest in the source.
39	[P+13]	Towards Efﬁcient, Portable Application-Level Consistency	Thanumalayan S. Pillai, Vijay Chidambaram, Joo-Young Hwang, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, and Remzi H. ArpaciDusseau. HotDep ’13, November 2013.	Our own work that shows how readily applications can make mistakes in committing data to disk; in particular, assumptions about the ﬁle system creep into applications and thus make the applications work correctly only if they are running on a speciﬁc ﬁle system.
39	[H+18]	TxFS: Leveraging File-System Crash Consistency to Provide ACID Transactions	Y. Hu, Z. Zhu, I. Neal, Y. Kwon, T. Cheng, V. Chidambaram, E. Witchel. USENIX ATC ’18, June 2018.	The best paper at USENIX ATC ’18, and a good recent place to start to learn about transactional ﬁle systems.
40	[A+07]	A Five-Year Study of File-System Metadata	Nitin Agrawal, William J. Bolosky, John R. Douceur, Jacob R. Lorch. FAST ’07, San Jose, California, February 2007.

40	[S+96]	Scalability in the XFS File System	Adan Sweeney, Doug Doucette, Wei Hu, Curtis Anderson, Mike Nishimoto, Geoff Peck. USENIX ’96, January 1996, San Diego, California.	The ﬁrst attempt to make scalability of operations, including things like having millions of ﬁles in a directory, a central focus. A great example of pushing an idea to the extreme. The key idea behind this ﬁle system: everything is a tree. We should have a chapter on this ﬁle system too.
40	[H+88]	Scale and Performance in a Distributed File System	John H. Howard, Michael L. Kazar, Sherri G. Menees, David A. Nichols, M. Satyanarayanan, Robert N. Sidebotham, Michael J. West..

40	[B02]	The FAT File System	Andries Brouwer. September, 2002. Available online at: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/fs/fat/fat.html.	A nice clean description of FAT. The ﬁle system kind, not the bacon kind. Though you have to admit, bacon fat probably tastes better.
40	[P09]	The Second Extended File System: Internal Layout	Dave Poirier. 2009. Available: http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html.	Some details on ext2, a very simple Linux ﬁle system based on FFS, the Berkeley Fast File System. We’ll be reading about it in the next chapter.
40	[RT74]	The U NIX Time-Sharing System	M. Ritchie, K. Thompson. CACM Volume 17:7, 1974.	The original paper about UNIX. Read it to see the underpinnings of much of modern operating systems.
40	[S00]	UBC: An Efﬁcient Uniﬁed I/O and Memory Caching Subsystem for NetBSD	Chuck Silvers. FREENIX, 2000.	A nice paper about NetBSD’s integration of ﬁle-system buffer caching and the virtual-memory page cache. Many other systems do the same type of thing.
40	[B07]	ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems	Jeff Bonwick and Bill Moore. Available from: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/zfs_last.pdf. 	One of the most recent important ﬁle systems, full of features and awesomeness. We should have a chapter on it, and perhaps soon will.
41	[MJLF84]	A Fast File System for UNIX	Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Sam J. Lefﬂer, Robert S. Fabry. ACM TOCS, 2:3, August 1984. McKusick was recently honored with the IEEE Reynold B.	Johnson award for his contributions to ﬁle systems, much of which was based on his work building FFS. In his acceptance speech, he discussed the original FFS software: only 1200 lines of code! Modern versions are a little more complex, e.g., the BSD FFS descendant now is in the 50-thousand lines-of-code range.
41	[P98]	Hardware Technology Trends and Database Opportunities	David A. Patterson. Keynote Lecture at SIGMOD ’98, June 1998.	A great and simple overview of disk technology trends and how they change over time.
41	[AD14a]	Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces” (Chapter: Hard Disk Drives)	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau . Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014.	There is no way you should be reading about FFS without having ﬁrst understood hard drives in some detail. If you try to do so, please instead go directly to jail; do not pass go, and, critically, do not collect 200 much-needed simoleons.
41	[AD14b]	Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces” (Chapter: File System Implementation)	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014. 	As above, it makes little sense to read this chapter unless you have read (and understood) the chapter on ﬁle system implementation. Otherwise, we’ll be throwing around terms like "inode" and "indirect block” and you’ll be like "huh?” and that is no fun for either of us.
41	[K94]	The Design of the SEER Predictive Caching System	G. H. Kuenning. MOBICOMM ’94, Santa Cruz, California, December 1994.	According to Kuenning, this is the best overview of the SEER project, which led to (among other things) the collection of these traces.
42	[MJLF84]	A Fast File System for UNIX	Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Sam J. Lefﬂer, Robert S. Fabry. ACM Transactions on Computing Systems, Volume 2:3, August 1984.	You already know enough about FFS, right? But come on, it is OK to re-reference important papers.
42	[P+14]	All File Systems Are Not Created Equal: On the Complexity of Crafting Crash-Consistent Applications	Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai, Vijay Chidambaram, Ramnatthan Alagappan, Samer Al-Kiswany, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. OSDI ’14, Broomﬁeld, Colorado, October 2014.	A paper in which we study what ﬁle systems guarantee after crashes, and show that applications expect something different, leading to all sorts of interesting problems.
42	[PAA05]	Analysis and Evolution of Journaling File Systems	Vijayan Prabhakaran, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. USENIX ’05, Anaheim, California, April 2005.	An early paper we wrote analyzing how journaling ﬁle systems work.

DSN ’11, Hong Kong, China, June 2011.	 Our own paper on the problem of disks that buffer writes in a memory cache instead of forcing them to disk, even when explicitly told not to do that! Our solution to overcome this problem: if you want A to be written to disk before B, ﬁrst write A, then send a lot of "dummy” writes to disk, hopefully causing A to be forced to disk to make room for them in the cache. A neat if impractical solution.
42	[C+12]	Consistency Without Ordering	Vijay Chidambaram, Tushar Sharma, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. FAST ’12, San Jose, California.	A recent paper of ours about a new form of crash consistency based on back pointers. Read it for the exciting details!

SOSP ’05, Brighton, England, October 2005.	A paper mostly focused on studying how ﬁle systems react to disk failures. Towards the end, we introduce a transaction checksum to speed up logging, which was eventually adopted into Linux ext4.
42	[T98]	Journaling the Linux ext2fs File System	Stephen C. Tweedie. The Fourth Annual Linux Expo, May 1998.	Tweedie did much of the heavy lifting in adding journaling to the Linux ext2 ﬁle system; the result, not surprisingly, is called ext3. Some nice design decisions include the strong focus on backwards compatibility, e.g., you can just add a journaling ﬁle to an existing ext2 ﬁle system and then mount it as an ext3 ﬁle system.
42	[GP94]	Metadata Update Performance in File Systems	Gregory R. Ganger and Yale N. Patt. OSDI ’94.	A clever paper about using careful ordering of writes as the main way to achieve consistency. Implemented later in BSD-based systems.

42	[H87]	Reimplementing the Cedar File System Using Logging and Group Commit	Robert Hagmann. SOSP ’87, Austin, Texas, November 1987.	The ﬁrst work (that we know of) that applied write-ahead logging (a.k.a. journaling) to a ﬁle system.
42	[G+08]	SQCK: A Declarative File System Checker	Haryadi S. Gunawi, Abhishek Rajimwale, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. OSDI ’08, San Diego, California.	Our own paper on a new and better way to build a ﬁle system checker using SQL queries. We also show some problems with the existing checker, ﬁnding numerous bugs and odd behaviors, a direct result of the complexity of fsck.
42	[T01]	The Linux ext2 File System	Theodore Ts’o, June, 2001.. Available online here: http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/ext2.html.	A simple Linux ﬁle system based on the ideas found in FFS. For a while it was quite heavily used; now it is really just in the kernel as an example of a simple ﬁle system.
42	[B07]	ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems	Jeff Bonwick and Bill Moore. Available online: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/zfs_last.pdf. 	ZFS uses copy-on-write and journaling, actually, as in some cases, logging writes to disk will perform better.
43	[M94]	A Better Update Policy	Jeffrey C. Mogul. USENIX ATC ’94, June 1994.	In this paper, Mogul ﬁnds that read workloads can be harmed by buffering writes for too long and then sending them to the disk in a big burst. Thus, he recommends sending writes more frequently and in smaller batches.
43	[MJLF84]	A Fast File System for UNIX	Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Sam J. Lefﬂer, Robert S. Fabry. ACM TOCS, Volume 2:3, August 1984.	The original FFS paper; see the chapter on FFS for more details.
43	[R+13]	BTRFS: The Linux B-Tree Filesystem	Ohad Rodeh, Josef Bacik, Chris Mason. ACM Transactions on Storage, Volume 9 Issue 3, August 2013.	Finally, a good paper on BTRFS, a modern take on copy-on-write ﬁle systems.
43	[Z+12]	De-indirection for Flash-based SSDs with Nameless Writes	Yiying Zhang, Leo Prasath Arulraj, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. FAST ’13, San Jose, California, February 2013.	Our paper on a new way to build ﬂash-based storage devices, to avoid redundant mappings in the ﬁle system and FTL. The idea is for the device to pick the physical location of a write, and return the address to the ﬁle system, which stores the mapping.
43	[RO91]	Design and Implementation of the Log-structured File System	Mendel Rosenblum and John Ousterhout. SOSP ’91, Paciﬁc Grove, CA, October 1991.	The original SOSP paper about LFS, which has been cited by hundreds of other papers and inspired many real systems.

USENIX 1995 Technical Conference, New Orleans, Louisiana, 1995.	A paper that showed the LFS performance sometimes has problems, particularly for workloads with many calls to fsync() (such as database workloads). The paper was controversial at the time.
43	[P98]	Hardware Technology Trends and Database Opportunities	David A. Patterson. ACM SIGMOD ’98 Keynote, 1998. Available online here: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/ ~pattrsn/talks/keynote.html.	 A great set of slides on technology trends in computer systems. Hopefully, Patterson will create another of these sometime soon.
43	[MR+97]	Improving the Performance of Log-structured File Systems with Adaptive Methods	Jeanna Neefe Matthews, Drew Roselli, Adam M. Costello, Randolph Y. Wang, Thomas E. Anderson. SOSP 1997, pages 238-251, October, Saint Malo, France.	A more recent paper detailing better policies for cleaning in LFS.
43	[AD14]	Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (Chapter: Flash-based Solid State Drives) 	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014.	A bit gauche to refer you to another chapter in this very book, but who are we to judge?
43	[L77]	Physical Integrity in a Large Segmented Database	R. Lorie. ACM Transactions on Databases, Volume 2:1, 1977.	The original idea of shadow paging is presented here.
43	[H+17]	The Unwritten Contract of of Solid State Drives	Jun He, Sudarsun Kannan, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. EuroSys ’17, April 2017.	Which unwritten rules one must follow to extract high performance from an SSD? Interestingly, both request scale (large or parallel requests) and locality still matter, even on SSDs. The more things change ...
43	[SO90]	Write-Only Disk Caches	Jon A. Solworth, Cyril U. Orji. SIGMOD ’90, Atlantic City, New Jersey, May 1990.	An early study of write buffering and its beneﬁts. However, buffering for too long can be harmful: see Mogul [M94] for details.
43	[B07]	ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems	Jeff Bonwick and Bill Moore. Copy Available: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/zfs_last.pdf. 	Slides on ZFS; unfortunately, there is no great ZFS paper (yet). Maybe you will write one, so we can cite it here?

44	[A15]	Amazon Pricing Study	Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau. February, 2015.	This is not an actual paper, but rather one of the authors going to Amazon and looking at current prices of hard drives and SSDs. You too can repeat this study, and see what the costs are today. Do it!
44	[H+14]	An Aggressive Worn-out Flash Block Management Scheme To Alleviate SSD Performance Degradation	Ping Huang, Guanying Wu, Xubin He, Weijun Xiao. EuroSys ’14, 2014.	Recent work showing how to really get the most out of worn-out ﬂash blocks; neat!

49	[V72]	La Begueule	Francois-Marie Arouet a.k.a. Voltaire. Published in 1772.	Voltaire said a number of clever things, this being but one example. For example, Voltaire also said "If you have two religions in your land, the two will cut each others throats; but if you have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace.” What do you say to that, Democrats and Republicans?
49	[ES03]	New NFS Tracing Tools and Techniques for System Analysis	Daniel Ellard and Margo Seltzer. LISA ’03, San Diego, California.	An intricate, careful analysis of NFS done via passive tracing. By simply monitoring network trafﬁc, the authors show how to derive a vast amount of ﬁle system understanding.

ACM Transactions on Computing Systems (ACM TOCS), Volume 6:1, February 1988.	The long journal version of the famous AFS system, still in use in a number of places throughout the world, and also probably the earliest clear thinking on how to build distributed ﬁle systems. A wonderful combination of the science of measurement and principled engineering.
50	[S+85]	The ITC Distributed File System: Principles and Design	M. Satyanarayanan, J.H. Howard, D.A. Nichols, R.N. Sidebotham, A. Spector, M.J. West. SOSP ’85, Orcas Island, Washington, December 1985.	The older paper about a distributed ﬁle system. Much of the basic design of AFS is in place in this older system, but not the improvements for scale. The name change to "Andrew” is an homage to two people both named Andrew, Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon.
