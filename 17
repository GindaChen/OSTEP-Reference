[B+00] “Hoard: A Scalable Memory Allocator for Multithreaded Applications” by Emery D. Berger, Kathryn S. McKinley, Robert D. Blumofe, Paul R. Wilson. ASPLOS-IX, November 2000. Berger and company’s excellent allocator for multiprocessor systems. Beyond just being a fun paper, also used in practice!

[B94] “The Slab Allocator: An Object-Caching Kernel Memory Allocator” by Jeff Bonwick. USENIX ’94. A cool paper about how to build an allocator for an operating system kernel, and a great example of how to specialize for particular common object sizes.

[E06] “A Scalable Concurrent malloc(3) Implementation for FreeBSD” by Jason Evans. April, 2006. http://people.freebsd.org/˜jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf. A detailed look at how to build a real modern allocator for use in multiprocessors. The “jemalloc” allocator is in widespread use today, within FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mozilla Firefox, and within Facebook.

[K65] “A Fast Storage Allocator” by Kenneth C. Knowlton. Communications of the ACM, Volume 8:10, October 1965. The common reference for buddy allocation. Random strange fact: Knuth gives credit for the idea not to Knowlton but to Harry Markowitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist. Another strange fact: Knuth communicates all of his emails via a secretary; he doesn’t send email himself, rather he tells his secretary what email to send and then the secretary does the work of emailing. Last Knuth fact: he created TeX, the tool used to typeset this book. It is an amazing piece of software 4 . [S15] “Understanding glibc malloc” by Sploitfun. February, 2015. sploitfun.wordpress.com/ 2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/. A deep dive into how glibc malloc works. Amazingly detailed and a very cool read.

[W+95] “Dynamic Storage Allocation: A Survey and Critical Review” by Paul R. Wilson, Mark S. Johnstone, Michael Neely, David Boles. International Workshop on Memory Management, Scotland, UK, September 1995. An excellent and far-reaching survey of many facets of memory allocation. Far too much detail to go into in this tiny chapter!
