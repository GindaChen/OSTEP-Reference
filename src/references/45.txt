[B+07] “An Analysis of Latent Sector Errors in Disk Drives” by L. Bairavasundaram, G. Goodson, S. Pasupathy, J. Schindler. SIGMETRICS ’07, San Diego, CA. The ﬁrst paper to study latent sector errors in detail. The paper also won the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper award, named after a brilliant researcher and wonderful guy who passed away too soon. To show the OSTEP authors it was possible to move from the U.S. to Canada, Ken once sang us the Canadian national anthem, standing up in the middle of a restaurant to do so. We chose the U.S., but got this memory.

[B+08] “An Analysis of Data Corruption in the Storage Stack” by Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram, Garth R. Goodson, Bianca Schroeder, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. ArpaciDusseau. FAST ’08, San Jose, CA, February 2008. The ﬁrst paper to truly study disk corruption in great detail, focusing on how often such corruption occurs over three years for over 1.5 million drives.

[BS04] “Commercial Fault Tolerance: A Tale of Two Systems” by Wendy Bartlett, Lisa Spainhower. IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, Vol. 1:1, January 2004. This classic in building fault tolerant systems is an excellent overview of the state of the art from both IBM and Tandem. Another must read for those interested in the area.

[C+04] “Row-Diagonal Parity for Double Disk Failure Correction” by P. Corbett, B. English, A. Goel, T. Grcanac, S. Kleiman, J. Leong, S. Sankar. FAST ’04, San Jose, CA, February 2004. An early paper on how extra redundancy helps to solve the combined full-disk-failure/partial-disk-failure problem. Also a nice example of how to mix more theoretical work with practical.

[F04] “Checksums and Error Control” by Peter M. Fenwick. Copy available online here: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/checksums-03.pdf. A great simple tutorial on checksums, available to you for the amazing cost of free.

[F82] “An Arithmetic Checksum for Serial Transmissions” by John G. Fletcher. IEEE Transactions on Communication, Vol. 30:1, January 1982. Fletcher’s original work on his eponymous checksum. He didn’t call it the Fletcher checksum, rather he just didn’t call it anything; later, others named it after him. So don’t blame old Fletch for this seeming act of braggadocio. This anecdote might remind you of Rubik; Rubik never called it “Rubik’s cube”; rather, he just called it “my cube.”

[HLM94] “File System Design for an NFS File Server Appliance” by Dave Hitz, James Lau, Michael Malcolm. USENIX Spring ’94. The pioneering paper that describes the ideas and product at the heart of NetApp’s core. Based on this system, NetApp has grown into a multi-billion dollar storage company. To learn more about NetApp, read Hitz’s autobiography “How to Castrate a Bull” (which is the actual title, no joking). And you thought you could avoid bull castration by going into CS.

[K+08] “Parity Lost and Parity Regained” by Andrew Krioukov, Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram, Garth R. Goodson, Kiran Srinivasan, Randy Thelen, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. FAST ’08, San Jose, CA, February 2008. This work explores how different checksum schemes work (or don’t work) in protecting data. We reveal a number of interesting ﬂaws in current protection strategies.

[M13] “Cyclic Redundancy Checks” by unknown. Available: http://www.mathpages.com/ home/kmath458.htm. A super clear and concise description of CRCs. The internet is full of information, as it turns out.

[P+05] “IRON File Systems” by V. Prabhakaran, L. Bairavasundaram, N. Agrawal, H. Gunawi, A. Arpaci-Dusseau, R. Arpaci-Dusseau. SOSP ’05, Brighton, England. Our paper on how disks have partial failure modes, and a detailed study of how modern ﬁle systems react to such failures. As it turns out, rather poorly! We found numerous bugs, design ﬂaws, and other oddities in this work. Some of this has fed back into the Linux community, thus improving ﬁle system reliability. You’re welcome!

[RO91] “Design and Implementation of the Log-structured File System” by Mendel Rosenblum and John Ousterhout. SOSP ’91, Paciﬁc Grove, CA, October 1991. So cool we cite it again.

[S90] “Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using The State Machine Approach: A Tutorial” by Fred B. Schneider. ACM Surveys, Vol. 22, No. 4, December 1990. How to build fault tolerant services. A must read for those building distributed systems.

[Z+13] “Zettabyte Reliability with Flexible End-to-end Data Integrity” by Y. Zhang, D. Myers, A. Arpaci-Dusseau, R. Arpaci-Dusseau. MSST ’13, Long Beach, California, May 2013. How to add data protection to the page cache of a system. Out of space, otherwise we would write something...
