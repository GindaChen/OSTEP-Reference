[B+08]	An Analysis of Data Corruption in the Storage Stack	Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram, Garth R. Goodson, Bianca Schroeder, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. ArpaciDusseau. FAST ’08, San Jose, CA, February 2008. 	Our own work analyzing how often disks actually corrupt your data. Not often, but sometimes! And thus something a reliable storage system must consider.
[BJ88]	Disk Shadowing	D. Bitton and J. Gray. VLDB 1988. 	One of the ﬁrst papers to discuss mirroring, therein called "shadowing”.
[CL95]	Striping in a RAID level 5 disk array	Peter M. Chen and Edward K. Lee. SIGMETRICS 1995. 	A nice analysis of some of the important parameters in a RAID-5 disk array.
[C+04]	Row-Diagonal Parity for Double Disk Failure Correction	P. Corbett, B. English, A. Goel, T. Grcanac, S. Kleiman, J. Leong, S. Sankar. FAST ’04, February 2004. 	Though not the ﬁrst paper on a RAID system with two disks for parity, it is a recent and highly-understandable version of said idea. Read it to learn more.
[DAA05]	Journal-guided Resynchronization for Software RAID	Timothy E. Denehy, A. Arpaci-Dusseau, R. Arpaci-Dusseau. FAST 2005. 	Our own work on the consistent-update problem. Here we solve it for Software RAID by integrating the journaling machinery of the ﬁle system above with the software RAID beneath it.
[HLM94]	File System Design for an NFS File Server Appliance	Dave Hitz, James Lau, Michael Malcolm. USENIX Winter 1994, San Francisco, California, 1994. 	The sparse paper introducing a landmark product in storage, the write-anywhere ﬁle layout or WAFL ﬁle system that underlies the NetApp ﬁle server.
[K86]	Synchronized Disk Interleaving	M.Y. Kim. IEEE Transactions on Computers, Volume C-35: 11, November 1986. 	Some of the earliest work on RAID is found here.
[K88]	Small Disk Arrays – The Emerging Approach to High Performance	F. Kurzweil. Presentation at Spring COMPCON ’88, March 1, 1988, San Francisco, California. 	Another early RAID reference.
[P+88]	Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks	D. Patterson, G. Gibson, R. Katz. SIGMOD 1988. This is considered the RAID paper, written by famous authors Patterson, Gibson, and Katz. 	The paper has since won many test-of-time awards and ushered in the RAID era, including the name RAID itself!
[PB86]	Providing Fault Tolerance in Parallel Secondary Storage Systems	A. Park, K. Balasubramaniam. Department of Computer Science, Princeton, CS-TR-O57-86, November 1986. 	Another early work on RAID.
[SG86]	Disk Striping	K. Salem, H. Garcia-Molina. IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 1986. 	And yes, another early RAID work. There are a lot of these, which kind of came out of the woodwork when the RAID paper was published in SIGMOD.
[S84]	Byzantine Generals in Action: Implementing Fail-Stop Processors	F.B. Schneider. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 2(2):145154, May 1984. 	Finally, a paper that is not about RAID! This paper is actually about how systems fail, and how to make something behave in a fail-stop manner.
