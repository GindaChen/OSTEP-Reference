[ADR03]	More Than an Interface: SCSI vs. ATA	Dave Anderson, Jim Dykes, Erik Riedel. FAST ’03, 2003. 	One of the best recent-ish references on how modern disk drives really work; a must read for anyone interested in knowing more.
[CKR72]	Analysis of Scanning Policies for Reducing Disk Seek Times	 E.G. Coffman, L.A. Klimko, B. Ryan SIAM Journal of Computing, September 1972, Vol 1. No 3. 	Some of the early work in the ﬁeld of disk scheduling.
[HK+17]	The Unwritten Contract of Solid State Drives	Jun He, Sudarsun Kannan, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. EuroSys ’17, Belgrade, Serbia, April 2017. 	We take the idea of the unwritten contract, and extend it to SSDs. Using SSDs well seems as complicated than hard drives, and sometimes more so.
[ID01]	Anticipatory Scheduling: A Disk-scheduling Framework To Overcome Deceptive Idleness In Synchronous I/O	Sitaram Iyer, Peter Druschel. SOSP ’01, October 2001. 	A cool paper showing how waiting can improve disk scheduling: better requests may be on their way!
[JW91]	Disk Scheduling Algorithms Based On Rotational Position	D. Jacobson, J. Wilkes. Technical Report HPL-CSP-91-7rev1, Hewlett-Packard, February 1991. 	A more modern take on disk scheduling. It remains a technical report (and not a published paper) because the authors were scooped by Seltzer et al. [S90].
[RW92]	An Introduction to Disk Drive Modeling	C. Ruemmler, J. Wilkes. IEEE Computer, 27:3, March 1994. 	A terriﬁc introduction to the basics of disk operation. Some pieces are out of date, but most of the basics remain.
[SCO90]	Disk Scheduling Revisited	Margo Seltzer, Peter Chen, John Ousterhout. USENIX 1990. 	A paper that talks about how rotation matters too in the world of disk scheduling.
[SG04]	MEMS-based storage devices and standard disk interfaces: A square peg in a round hole?	 Steven W. Schlosser, Gregory R. Ganger FAST ’04, pp. 87-100, 2004 	While the MEMS aspect of this paper hasn’t yet made an impact, the discussion of the contract between ﬁle systems and disks is wonderful and a lasting contribution. We later build on this work to study the Unwritten Contract of Solid State Drives” [HK+17]
[S09a]	Barracuda ES.2 data sheet	Seagate, Inc.. Available at this website, at least, it was: http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds_barracuda_es.pdf. 	A data sheet; read at your own risk. Risk of what? Boredom.
[S09b]	Cheetah 15K.5	Seagate, Inc.. Available at this website, we’re pretty sure it is: http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds-cheetah-15k-5-us.pdf. 	See above commentary on data sheets.
