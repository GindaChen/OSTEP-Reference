[BOH10]	Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective	Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron. Addison-Wesley, 2010. 	We have yet to ﬁnd a good ﬁrst reference to the multi-level page table. However, this great textbook by Bryant and O’Hallaron dives into the details of x86, which at least is an early system that used such structures. It’s also just a great book to have.
[JM98]	Virtual Memory: Issues of Implementation	Bruce Jacob, Trevor Mudge. IEEE Computer, June 1998. 	An excellent survey of a number of different systems and their approach to virtualizing memory. Plenty of details on x86, PowerPC, MIPS, and other architectures.
[LL82]	Virtual Memory Management in the VAX/VMS Operating System	Hank Levy, P. Lipman. IEEE Computer, Vol. 15, No. 3, March 1982. 	A terriﬁc paper about a real virtual memory manager in a classic operating system, VMS. So terriﬁc, in fact, that we’ll use it to review everything we’ve learned about virtual memory thus far a few chapters from now.
[M28]	Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups	Mars Candy Corporation. Published at stores near you. 	Apparently these ﬁne confections were invented in 1928 by Harry Burnett Reese, a former dairy farmer and shipping foreman for one Milton S. Hershey. At least, that is what it says on Wikipedia. If true, Hershey and Reese probably hate each other’s guts, as any two chocolate barons should.
[N+02]	Practical, Transparent Operating System Support for Superpages	Juan Navarro, Sitaram Iyer, Peter Druschel, Alan Cox. OSDI ’02, Boston, Massachusetts, October 2002. 	A nice paper showing all the details you have to get right to incorporate large pages, or superpages, into a modern OS. Not as easy as you might think, alas.
[M07]	Multics: History	Available: http://www.multicians.org/history.html. 	This amazing web site provides a huge amount of history on the Multics system, certainly one of the most inﬂuential systems in OS history. The quote from therein: Jack Dennis of MIT contributed inﬂuential architectural ideas to the beginning of Multics, especially the idea of combining paging and segmentation.” (from Section 1.2.1)
