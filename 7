[B+79] “The Convoy Phenomenon” by M. Blasgen, J. Gray, M. Mitoma, T. Price. ACM Operating Systems Review, 13:2, April 1979. Perhaps the ﬁrst reference to convoys, which occurs in databases as well as the OS.

[C54] “Priority Assignment in Waiting Line Problems” by A. Cobham. Journal of Operations Research, 2:70, pages 70–76, 1954. The pioneering paper on using an SJF approach in scheduling the repair of machines.

[K64] “Analysis of a Time-Shared Processor” by Leonard Kleinrock. Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 11:1, pages 59–73, March 1964. May be the ﬁrst reference to the round-robin scheduling algorithm; certainly one of the ﬁrst analyses of said approach to scheduling a time-shared system.

[CK68] “Computer Scheduling Methods and their Countermeasures” by Edward G. Coffman and Leonard Kleinrock. AFIPS ’68 (Spring), April 1968. An excellent early introduction to and analysis of a number of basic scheduling disciplines.

[J91] “The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling” by R. Jain. Interscience, New York, April 1991. The standard text on computer systems measurement. A great reference for your library, for sure.

[O45] “Animal Farm” by George Orwell. Secker and Warburg (London), 1945. A great but depressing allegorical book about power and its corruptions. Some say it is a critique of Stalin and the pre-WWII Stalin era in the U.S.S.R; we say it’s a critique of pigs.

[PV56] “Machine Repair as a Priority Waiting-Line Problem” by Thomas E. Phipps Jr., W. R. Van Voorhis. Operations Research, 4:1, pages 76–86, February 1956. Follow-on work that generalizes the SJF approach to machine repair from Cobham’s original work; also postulates the utility of an STCF approach in such an environment. Speciﬁcally, “There are certain types of repair work, ... involving much dismantling and covering the ﬂoor with nuts and bolts, which certainly should not be interrupted once undertaken; in other cases it would be inadvisable to continue work on a long job if one or more short ones became available (p.81).”

[MB91] “The effect of context switches on cache performance” by Jeffrey C. Mogul, Anita Borg. ASPLOS, 1991. A nice study on how cache performance can be affected by context switching; less of an issue in today’s systems where processors issue billions of instructions per second but context-switches still happen in the millisecond time range.

[W15] “You can’t have your cake and eat it” by Authors: Unknown.. Wikipedia (as of December 2015). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You can’t have your cake and eat it. The best part of this page is reading all the similar idioms from other languages. In Tamil, you can’t “have both the moustache and drink the soup.”
