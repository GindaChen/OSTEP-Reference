[A79] 	Alto User’s Handbook 	Xerox. Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, September 1979. Available: http://history-computer.com/Library/AltoUsersHandbook.pdf. 	An amazing system, way ahead of its time. Became famous because Steve Jobs visited, took notes, and built Lisa and eventually Mac.
[C+04] 	Microreboot — A Technique for Cheap Recovery 	G. Candea, S. Kawamoto, Y. Fujiki, G. Friedman, A. Fox. OSDI ’04, San Francisco, CA, December 2004. 	An excellent paper pointing out how far one can go with reboot in building more robust systems.
[I11] 	Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual 	Volume 3A and 3B: System Programming Guide. Intel Corporation, January 2011. 	This is just a boring manual, but sometimes those are useful.
[K+61] 	One-Level Storage System 	T. Kilburn, D.B.G. Edwards, M.J. Lanigan, F.H. Sumner. IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers, April 1962. 	The Atlas pioneered much of what you see in modern systems. However, this paper is not the best one to read. If you were to only read one, you might try the historical perspective below [L78].
[L78] 	The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A Historical Perspective 	S. H. Lavington. Communications of the ACM, 21:1, January 1978. 	A history of the early development of computers and the pioneering efforts of Atlas.
[M+63] 	A Time-Sharing Debugging System for a Small Computer 	J. McCarthy, S. Boilen, E. Fredkin, J. C. R. Licklider. AFIPS ’63 (Spring), May, 1963, New York, USA. An early paper about time-sharing that refers to using a timer interrupt; the quote that discusses it: 	The basic task of the channel 17 clock routine is to decide whether to remove the current user from core and if so to decide which user program to swap in as he goes out.”
[MS96] 	lmbench: Portable tools for performance analysis 	Larry McVoy and Carl Staelin. USENIX Annual Technical Conference, January 1996. 	A fun paper about how to measure a number of different things about your OS and its performance. Download lmbench and give it a try.
[M11] 	Mac OS 9 	Apple Computer, Inc.. January 2011. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Mac OS 9 . 	You can probably even ﬁnd an OS 9 emulator out there if you want to; check it out, it’s a fun little Mac!
[O90] 	Why Aren’t Operating Systems Getting Faster as Fast as Hardware? 	J. Ousterhout. USENIX Summer Conference, June 1990. 	A classic paper on the nature of operating system performance.
[P10] 	The Single UNIX Speciﬁcation, Version 3 	The Open Group, May 2010. Available: http://www.unix.org/version3/. 	This is hard and painful to read, so probably avoid it if you can. Like, unless someone is paying you to read it. Or, you’re just so curious you can’t help it!
[S07] 	The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86) 	Hovav Shacham. CCS ’07, October 2007. 	One of those awesome, mind-blowing ideas that you’ll see in research from time to time. The author shows that if you can jump into code arbitrarily, you can essentially stitch together any code sequence you like (given a large code base); read the paper for the details. The technique makes it even harder to defend against malicious attacks, alas.
