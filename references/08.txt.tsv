[AD00] 	Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling in Solaris 	Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. Available: http://www.ostep.org/Citations/notes-solaris.pdf. 	A great short set of notes by one of the authors on the details of the Solaris scheduler. OK, we are probably biased in this description, but the notes are pretty darn good.
[B86] 	The Design of the U NIX Operating System 	M.J. Bach. Prentice-Hall, 1986. 	One of the classic old books on how a real U NIX operating system is built; a deﬁnite must-read for kernel hackers.
[C+62] 	An Experimental Time-Sharing System 	F. J. Corbato, M. M. Daggett, R. C. Daley. IFIPS 1962. 	A bit hard to read, but the source of many of the ﬁrst ideas in multi-level feedback scheduling. Much of this later went into Multics, which one could argue was the most inﬂuential operating system of all time.
[CS97] 	Inside Windows NT 	Helen Custer and David A. Solomon. Microsoft Press, 1997. 	The NT book, if you want to learn about something other than U NIX. Of course, why would you? OK, we’re kidding; you might actually work for Microsoft some day you know.
[E95] 	An Analysis of Decay-Usage Scheduling in Multiprocessors 	D.H.J. Epema. SIGMETRICS ’95. 	A nice paper on the state of the art of scheduling back in the mid 1990s, including a good overview of the basic approach behind decay-usage schedulers.
[LM+89] 	The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD U NIX Operating System 	S.J. Lefﬂer, M.K. McKusick, M.J. Karels, J.S. Quarterman. Addison-Wesley, 1989. 	Another OS classic, written by four of the main people behind BSD. The later versions of this book, while more up to date, don’t quite match the beauty of this one.
[M06] 	Solaris Internals: Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris Kernel Architecture 	Richard McDougall. Prentice-Hall, 2006. 	A good book about Solaris and how it works.
[O11] 	John Ousterhout’s Home Page 	John Ousterhout. www.stanford.edu/˜ouster/. 	The home page of the famous Professor Ousterhout. The two co-authors of this book had the pleasure of taking graduate operating systems from Ousterhout while in graduate school; indeed, this is where the two co-authors got to know each other, eventually leading to marriage, kids, and even this book. Thus, you really can blame Ousterhout for this entire mess you’re in.
[P+95] 	Informed Prefetching and Caching 	R.H. Patterson, G.A. Gibson, E. Ginting, D. Stodolsky, J. Zelenka. SOSP ’95, Copper Mountain, Colorado, October 1995. 	A fun paper about some very cool ideas in ﬁle systems, including how applications can give the OS advice about what ﬁles it is accessing and how it plans to access them.
[Y+18] 	Principled Schedulability Analysis for Distributed Storage Systems using Thread Architecture Models 	Suli Yang, Jing Liu, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H. ArpaciDusseau. OSDI ’18, San Diego, California. 	A recent work of our group that demonstrates the difﬁculty of scheduling I/O requests within modern distributed storage systems such as Hive/HDFS, Cassandra, MongoDB, and Riak. Without care, a single user might be able to monopolize system resources.
