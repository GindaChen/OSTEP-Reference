[AD14a] “Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces” (Chapter: Hard Disk Drives) by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014. There is no way you should be reading about FFS without having ﬁrst understood hard drives in some detail. If you try to do so, please instead go directly to jail; do not pass go, and, critically, do not collect 200 much-needed simoleons.

[AD14b] “Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces” (Chapter: File System Implementation) by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau . Arpaci-Dusseau Books, 2014. As above, it makes little sense to read this chapter unless you have read (and understood) the chapter on ﬁle system implementation. Otherwise, we’ll be throwing around terms like “inode” and “indirect block” and you’ll be like “huh?” and that is no fun for either of us.

[K94] “The Design of the SEER Predictive Caching System” by G. H. Kuenning. MOBICOMM ’94, Santa Cruz, California, December 1994. According to Kuenning, this is the best overview of the SEER project, which led to (among other things) the collection of these traces.

[MJLF84] “A Fast File System for U NIX” by Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Sam J. Lefﬂer, Robert S. Fabry. ACM TOCS, 2:3, August 1984. McKusick was recently honored with the IEEE Reynold B. Johnson award for his contributions to ﬁle systems, much of which was based on his work building FFS. In his acceptance speech, he discussed the original FFS software: only 1200 lines of code! Modern versions are a little more complex, e.g., the BSD FFS descendant now is in the 50-thousand lines-of-code range.

[P98] “Hardware Technology Trends and Database Opportunities” by David A. Patterson. Keynote Lecture at SIGMOD ’98, June 1998. A great and simple overview of disk technology trends and how they change over time.
