[BH70] 	The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System 	 Per Brinch Hansen. Communications of the ACM, Volume 13:4, April 1970. 	This paper introduces one of the ﬁrst microkernels in operating systems history, called Nucleus. The idea of smaller, more minimal systems is a theme that rears its head repeatedly in OS history; it all began with Brinch Hansen’s work described herein.
[CK+08] 	The xv6 Operating System 	 Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich. From: https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public. 	The coolest real and little OS in the world. Download and play with it to learn more about the details of how operating systems actually work. We have been using an older version (2012-01-30-1-g1c41342) and hence some examples in the book may not match the latest in the source.
[DV66] 	Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations 	 Jack B. Dennis, Earl C. Van Horn. 	Communications of the ACM, Volume 9, Number 3, March 1966 . This paper deﬁned many of the early terms and concepts around building multiprogrammed systems.
[L+75] 	Policy/mechanism separation in Hydra 	 R. Levin, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, F. Pollack, W. Wulf. SOSP ’75, Austin, Texas, November 1975. 	An early paper about how to structure operating systems in a research OS known as Hydra. While Hydra never became a mainstream OS, some of its ideas inﬂuenced OS designers.
[V+65] 	Structure of the Multics Supervisor 	 V.A. Vyssotsky, F. J. Corbato, R. M. Graham. Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1965. 	An early paper on Multics, which described many of the basic ideas and terms that we ﬁnd in modern systems. Some of the vision behind computing as a utility are ﬁnally being realized in modern cloud systems.
