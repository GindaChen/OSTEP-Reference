Our own paper which lays out ﬁve rules clients should follow in order to get the best performance out of modern SSDs. The rules are request scale, locality, aligned sequentiality, grouping by death time, and uniform lifetime. Read the paper for details!

[H+14] “An Aggressive Worn-out Flash Block Management Scheme To Alleviate SSD Performance Degradation” by Ping Huang, Guanying Wu, Xubin He, Weijun Xiao. EuroSys ’14, 2014. Recent work showing how to really get the most out of worn-out ﬂash blocks; neat!
