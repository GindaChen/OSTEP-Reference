[A70] “The ALOHA System — Another Alternative for Computer Communications” by Norman Abramson. The 1970 Fall Joint Computer Conference. The ALOHA network pioneered some basic concepts in networking, including exponential back-off and retransmit, which formed the basis for communication in shared-bus Ethernet networks for years.

[BN84] “Implementing Remote Procedure Calls” by Andrew D. Birrell, Bruce Jay Nelson. ACM TOCS, Volume 2:1, February 1984. The foundational RPC system upon which all others build. Yes, another pioneering effort from our friends at Xerox PARC.

[MK09] “The Effectiveness of Checksums for Embedded Control Networks” by Theresa C. Maxino and Philip J. Koopman. IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 6:1, January ’09. A nice overview of basic checksum machinery and some performance and robustness comparisons between them.

[LH89] “Memory Coherence in Shared Virtual Memory Systems” by Kai Li and Paul Hudak. ACM TOCS, 7:4, November 1989. The introduction of software-based shared memory via virtual memory. An intriguing idea for sure, but not a lasting or good one in the end.

[SK09] “Principles of Computer System Design” by Jerome H. Saltzer and M. Frans Kaashoek. Morgan-Kaufmann, 2009. An excellent book on systems, and a must for every bookshelf. One of the few terriﬁc discussions on naming we’ve seen.

[SRC84] “End-To-End Arguments in System Design” by Jerome H. Saltzer, David P. Reed, David D. Clark. ACM TOCS, 2:4, November 1984. A beautiful discussion of layering, abstraction, and where functionality must ultimately reside in computer systems.

[VJ88] “Congestion Avoidance and Control” by Van Jacobson. SIGCOMM ’88 . A pioneering paper on how clients should adjust to perceived network congestion; deﬁnitely one of the key pieces of technology underlying the Internet, and a must read for anyone serious about systems, and for Van Jacobson’s relatives because well relatives should read all of your papers.
