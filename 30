[D68] “Cooperating sequential processes” by Edsger W. Dijkstra. 1968. Available online here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD123.PDF. Another classic from Dijkstra; reading his early works on concurrency will teach you much of what you need to know.

[D72] “Information Streams Sharing a Finite Buffer” by E.W. Dijkstra. Information Processing Letters 1: 179180, 1972. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD329.PDF The famous paper that introduced the producer/consumer problem.

[D01] “My recollections of operating system design” by E.W. Dijkstra. April, 2001. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd13xx/EWD1303.PDF. A fascinating read for those of you interested in how the pioneers of our ﬁeld came up with some very basic and fundamental concepts, including ideas like “interrupts” and even “a stack”!

[H74] “Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept” by C.A.R. Hoare. Communications of the ACM, 17:10, pages 549–557, October 1974. Hoare did a fair amount of theoretical work in concurrency. However, he is still probably most known for his work on Quicksort, the coolest sorting algorithm in the world, at least according to these authors.

[L11] “Pthread cond signal Man Page” by Mysterious author. March, 2011. Available online: http://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread cond signal. The Linux man page shows a nice simple example of why a thread might get a spurious wakeup, due to race conditions within the signal/wakeup code.

[LR80] “Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa” by B.W. Lampson, D.R. Redell. Communications of the ACM. 23:2, pages 105-117, February 1980. A terriﬁc paper about how to actually implement signaling and condition variables in a real system, leading to the term “Mesa” semantics for what it mzshortns to be woken up; the older semantics, developed by Tony Hoare [H74], then became known as “Hoare” semantics, which is hard to say out loud in class with a straight face.

[O49] “1984” by George Orwell. Secker and Warburg, 1949. A little heavy-handed, but of course a must read. That said, we kind of gave away the ending by quoting the last sentence. Sorry! And if the government is reading this, let us just say that we think that the government is “double plus good”. Hear that, our pals at the NSA?
